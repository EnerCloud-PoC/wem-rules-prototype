<p>This 'companion' version of the WEM Rules shows the Amending Rules as

that delete entire clauses or sections or transitional Amending Rules
which are to be deleted prior to the commencement of the new Market are
not shown and users should refer to the relevant Ministerial Instruments
to see those amendments. However, where an amendment only comprises a
partial deletion of a clause, the clause is shown in 'green' or 'blue',
as applicable, until it is commenced (when it will be shown in
'black').</p>

\(a\) to promote the economically efficient, safe and reliable
production and supply of electricity and electricity related services in
the South West interconnected system;

\(b\) to encourage competition among generators and retailers in the
South West interconnected system, including by facilitating efficient
entry of new competitors;

\(c\) to avoid discrimination in that market against particular energy
options and technologies, including sustainable energy options and
technologies such as those that make use of renewable resources or that
reduce overall greenhouse gas emissions;

\(d\) to minimise the long-term cost of electricity supplied to
customers from the South West interconnected system; and

\(e\) to encourage the taking of measures to manage the amount of
electricity used and when it is used.

Conventions

1.3. Electricity Industry Act and Regulations

<p>Clauses 1.7.1 to 1.7.4 are amended to reflect the new Market
Information Framework. AEMO, the ERA and the Coordinator will only be
required to publish Public Information, which by its nature should be
available to any person. Chapter 10 provides flexibility to AEMO, the
ERA and the Coordinator regarding the means by which Confidential
Information is disclosed.</p>
<p>The clauses have been further amended to remove the reference to
“releasing” documents or information (because some information
“released” under WEM Rules is not Public Information) and to clarify the
“publishing” a document means publishing it in a place that is
accessible all members of the public.</p></th>

Commencement Day.

**WEM Participant:** Means the Coordinator, a Rule Participant and the
Economic Regulation Authority.

1.36C.2. Before 8:00 AM on an Amending Rules Commencement Day,
notwithstanding that the Pre‑Amended Rules continue to apply, each WEM
Participant must perform all obligations imposed on that WEM Participant
under the Post‑Amended Rules, in relation to that Amending Rules
Commencement Day and subsequent Trading Days, that, if the Post‑Amended
Rules were in force, the WEM Participant would have been required to
perform under the Post‑Amended Rules.

1.36C.3. If before 8:00 AM on an Amending Rules Commencement Day,
notwithstanding that the Pre‑Amended Rules continue to apply, a WEM
Participant performs an obligation under the Post‑Amended Rules under
clause 1.36C.2, then to the extent that the obligation is performed, the
WEM Participant is not required to perform any equivalent obligation
under the Pre‑Amended Rules to the extent that these obligations relate

that, if the Pre‑Amended Rules were in force, the WEM Participant would
have been required to perform under the Pre‑Amended Rules other than
those obligations the WEM Participant is not required to perform
pursuant to clause 1.36C.3.

1.36C.6. Where a Commenced Amending Rule requires the operation of one
or more Specific Amending Rules that have not yet commenced, then regard
may be had to those Specific Amending Rules to interpret or give effect
to the Commenced Amending Rule even though the Specific Amending Rules
have not yet commenced.

1.36C.7. Where any Commenced Amending Rule requires the operation of WEM
Rules which have been amended, repealed or replaced by one or more

\(a\) the relevant Rule Participant responsible for the WEM Procedure
must, as soon as practicable after the Administrative Amendments
Commencement Day, amend the WEM Procedure to refer to AEMO instead of
System Management and make any consequential amendments that AEMO
considers reasonably necessary to give effect to the Administrative
Amendments without undertaking the Procedure Change Process;

\(b\) any WEM Procedure which is amended in accordance with
clause 1.37.2(a) commences operation on the date and time determined by
the relevant Rule Participant responsible for the WEM Procedure and
published on the WEM Website; and

\(c\) until any WEM Procedure is amended and commenced in accordance
with clauses 1.37.2(a) and 1.37.2(b), a reference in a WEM Procedure
that should be a reference to AEMO having regard to AEMO’s functions,
including System Operation Functions, rights and obligations under these
WEM Rules and any other WEM Procedure, is deemed to be a reference to
AEMO.

1.37.3. On and from the Administrative Amendments Commencement Day, all
market information that AEMO has set the class of confidentiality status
as System Management Confidential in accordance with clause 10.2.1 or
section 10.9 of the Pre-Amended Rules, is to be deemed to be the
confidentiality status of System Operation Confidential under the
Post-Amended Rules.

\(a\) set out in and required by an Arrangement for Access; or

\(b\) otherwise previously agreed by the Network Operator at the time of
connection of the Existing Transmission Connected Generating System to
the SWIS, or prior to the Tranche 1 Commencement Date,

and includes any condition or circumstance which is of similar effect as
a Generator Condition in respect of an existing standard or technical
level of performance for the Existing Transmission Connected Generating
System.

**Agreed Generator Performance Standard:** Means the standard or
technical level of performance in respect of a Technical Requirement
that is either:

\(a\) agreed between a Market Participant responsible for an Existing
Transmission Connected Generating System and the relevant Network
Operator; or

\(b\) deemed to be the applicable standard or technical level of
performance in respect of the same matter as a Technical Requirement
that applies in respect of an Existing Transmission Connected Generating
System,

in accordance with this section 1.40.

**Generator Condition:** Means one or more circumstances specified in a
Proposed Alternative Standard:

\(a\) the occurrence of which requires a Market Participant responsible
for an Existing Transmission Connected Generating System to undertake
required actions to achieve an agreed outcome and or achieve an agreed
higher level of performance than set out in the Proposed Alternative
Standard in respect of one or more Technical Requirements; and

\(b\) that specifies or describes each of the matters in clauses
3A.5.6(a) to 3A.5.6(g), where each reference to 'Trigger Event' in those
clauses is to be read as 'Generator Condition'.

**Proposed Alternative Standard:** Means a standard or technical level
of performance in respect of a Technical Requirement proposed to apply
to an Existing Transmission Connected Generating System that has been
submitted in accordance with clause 1.40.6.

the ERA more flexibility in directing AEMO to monitor compliance with
Rule changes where AEMO is the party best placed to do so, and for this
list of WEM Rules monitoring by AEMO to change over time to remain more
relevant as the market evolves. Transparency will be provided to Market

Market Power Mitigation

2.16A. General Trading Obligations

2.16A.1. A Market Participant must offer prices in each of its STEM
Submissions and Real‑Time Market Submissions that reflect only the costs
that a Market Participant without market power would include in forming
profit-maximising price offers in a STEM Submission or Real-Time Market
Submission.

2.16A.2. The Economic Regulation Authority must not determine that a
Market Participant has engaged in conduct prohibited by clause 2.16A.1
unless the Economic Regulation Authority has first determined that the
Market Participant had market power at the time of offering the relevant
prices in its STEM Submission or Real‑Time Market Submission.

2.16A.3. A Market Participant must not engage in conduct in the STEM or
Real-Time Market that:

\(a\) is false, misleading or deceptive, or likely to mislead or
deceive;

\(b\) is fraudulent, dishonest or in bad faith; or

\(c\) has the purpose, or has or is likely to have the effect, of
distorting or manipulating prices in the Wholesale Electricity Market.

2.16A.4. In determining whether a Market Participant has engaged in
conduct prohibited by clause 2.16A.3, the Economic Regulation Authority
may take into account:

\(a\) historical STEM Submissions or Real-Time Market Submissions made
by the Market Participant with effect on or after the New WEM
Commencement Day, including changes to STEM Submissions and Real-Time
Market Submissions in which there is, or there appears to be, a pattern
of behaviour that may indicate such conduct was engaged in;

\(b\) the timeliness and accuracy of notification of Forced Outages by
the Market Participant;

\(c\) information regarding whether the Market Participant did not
comply with a Dispatch Instruction in respect of its Facility and the
reasons for the non-compliance; and

\(d\) any other information the Economic Regulation Authority considers
relevant to its determination.

2.16A.5. A STEM Submission or a Real-Time Market Submission is not made
in bad faith under clause 2.16A.3(b) if, at the time it is submitted,
the Market Participant had a genuine intention to honour the terms of
that STEM Submission or Real-Time Market Submission if the material
conditions and circumstances upon which the STEM Submission or Real-Time
Market Submission was based remained unchanged until the relevant
Trading Interval.

2.16A.6. A Market Participant may be taken to have made a STEM
Submission or a Real‑Time Market Submission in bad faith notwithstanding
that the intention of the Market Participant is ascertainable only by
inference from:

\(a\) the conduct of the Market Participant;

\(b\) the conduct of any other person; or

\(c\) the relevant circumstances.

2.16A.7. If a Market Participant does not have reasonable grounds for a
price, quantity, or Ramp Rate Limit, as applicable, it has included in a
Real-Time Market Submission at the time it submits that Real-Time Market
Submission, then the Market Participant is, for the purposes of clause
2.16A.3(a), taken to have known that the Real-Time Market Submission was
likely to lead to another Rule Participant being misled or deceived as
to the existence or non-existence of a material fact relating to the
Real‑Time Market.

2.16A.8. For the purposes of clause 2.16A.7, a Market Participant must
adduce evidence that it had reasonable grounds for including a price,
quantity or Ramp Rate Limit, as applicable, in the Real-Time Market
Submission. To avoid doubt, the effect of this clause is to place an
evidentiary burden on a Market Participant, and this clause does not
have the effect that, merely because such evidence is adduced, the
Market Participant who submitted the Real-Time Market Submission is
taken to have had reasonable grounds for including a price, quantity or
Ramp Rate Limit, as applicable.

2.16A.9. Clause 2.16A.7 does not imply that merely because a Market
Participant had reasonable grounds for making the representation or the
conduct referred to in Chapter 7, in respect of the Real-Time Market,
and in particular putting the price, quantity or Ramp Rate Limit, as
applicable, in a Real-Time Market Submission submitted by the Market
Participant, that such representation or conduct is not misleading.

2.16B. Portfolio Assessment

2.16B.1. The Economic Regulation Authority must, in accordance with the
WEM Procedure referred to in clause 2.16D.15:

\(a\) by 1 April and 1 October each year, identify each Portfolio

principles:

i\. each Scheduled Facility, Semi-Scheduled Facility and Non‑Scheduled
Facility must be allocated to one, but not more than one, Portfolio;

ii\. Registered Facilities which are owned by or registered to the same
Market Participant must be allocated to the same Portfolio;

iii\. Registered Facilities which are owned by or registered to Market
Participants that are associated entities (as that expression is defined
in the Corporations Act) must be allocated to the same Portfolio;

iv\. Registered Facilities which are registered to, or owned or
controlled by, a Market Participant or other entity, and Registered
Facilities that are registered to, or owned or controlled by, an
associated entity of that Market Participant or other entity (as those
expressions are defined in the Corporations Act) must be allocated to
the same Portfolio; and

v\. without limiting clause 2.16B.1(a)(i), a Registered Facility must
not be allocated to a Portfolio containing another Registered Facility
unless it is required by clauses 2.16B.1(a)(ii), 2.16B.1(a)(iii) or
2.16B.1(a)(iv); and

\(b\) within 10 Business Days of identifying each Portfolio under clause

where:

i\. MSOC(f) is the maximum sent out capacity specified for Registered
Facility f in Appendix 1(b)(v), Appendix 1(c)(v) or Appendix 1(d)(v) as
applicable;

ii\. f∈p denotes all Scheduled Facilities, Semi-Scheduled Facilities and
Non-Scheduled Facilities f assigned to Portfolio p; and

iii\. f∈Facilities denotes all Scheduled Facilities, Semi-Scheduled
Facilities and Non-Scheduled Facilities assigned to a Portfolio
identified under clause 2.16B.1(a);

Regulation Authority under clause 2.16C.1(b) replaces the previous set
of Material Portfolios identified by the Economic Regulation Authority
under clause 2.16C.1(b) (if any) with effect from the time that the
Economic Regulation Authority publishes the results of the relevant
calculations under clause 2.16C.1(c)(i).

2.16C.2. The Economic Regulation Authority must, not more than 20
Business Days following the end of a Rolling Test Window, in accordance
with the WEM Procedure referred to in clause 2.16D.15:

\(a\) calculate for that Rolling Test Window and for any relevant Fixed
Assessment Period, as a percentage, the Constrained Uplift Payment Ratio
for each Constrained Portfolio identified under clause 2.16B.2(b) as
follows:

$$\text{Constrained}\text{\\}\text{Uplift}\text{\\}\text{Payment}\text{\\}\text{Ratio}\text{\\}\text{=\\}\frac{\text{CP}\text{\\}\text{UP}}{\text{NC}} \times \text{100}$$

where:

i\. CP\_UP is the number of Dispatch Intervals in the Rolling Test
Window or Fixed Assessment Period (as applicable) in which:

1\. the Constraint Equation relevant to the identification of the
Constrained Portfolio identified under clause 2.16B.2(a) bound; and

2\. a Registered Facility in the Constrained Portfolio received an
Energy Uplift Payment; and

2.16C.2(a) and 2.16C.2(b) on its website; and

\(d\) notify each Market Participant that has a Registered Facility
assigned to a Material Constrained Portfolio identified under clause
2.16.2C(b).

2.16C.2A. Each set of Material Constrained Portfolios identified by the
Economic Regulation Authority under clause 2.16C.2(b) replaces the
previous set of Material Constrained Portfolios identified by the
Economic Regulation Authority under clause 2.16C.2(b) (if any) with
effect from the time that the Economic Regulation Authority publishes
the results of the relevant calculations under 2.16C.2(c).

2.16C.3. By no later than three months from the date of receipt of a
notice from the Economic Regulation Authority under clause
2.16C.1(c)(ii) or clause 2.16C.2(d), a Market Participant must, in
accordance with the WEM Procedure referred to in clause 2.16D.15:

\(c\) a price offered by a Market Participant in its Portfolio Supply
Curve was inconsistent with the price that a Market Participant without
market power would offer in a profit-maximising Portfolio Supply Curve;
or

\(d\) a price offered by a Market Participant in its Real-Time Market
Submissions was inconsistent with the price that a Market Participant
without market power would offer in a profit-maximising Real-Time
Market,

the Economic Regulation Authority must determine that the price was an
Irregular Price Offer.

2.16C.7. The Economic Regulation Authority must investigate and
determine, in accordance with clause 2.13.27 and the WEM Procedure
referred to in clause 2.16D.15, whether an Irregular Price Offer
determined under clause 2.16C.6 has resulted in an inefficient market
outcome.

2.16C.8. Without limiting clauses 2.16C.6 and 2.16C.7, the Economic
Regulation Authority must make a determination under clause 2.16C.6 and,
if necessary, under clause 2.16C.7, no later than six months from the
day the Economic Regulation Authority commenced its investigation under
clause 2.16C.6.

2.16C.9. In conducting an investigation under clause 2.16C.7, the
Economic Regulation Authority:

\(a\) must consider any changes to:

i\. a STEM Clearing Price or Reference Trading Price;

ii\. Energy Uplift Payments; or

iii\. the quantities of energy scheduled in respect of Market
Participants in the STEM Auction, or the dispatch of Facilities in the
Real-Time Market,

that are likely to have occurred as a result of the Irregular Price
Offer; and

\(b\) may consider any other matters it considers relevant.

2.16C.10. If, following an investigation, the Economic Regulation
Authority has determined pursuant to clause 2.16C.6 and clause 2.16C.7
that a Market Participant has breached the obligation specified in
clause 2.16C.5, the Economic Regulation Authority must:

\(a\) at least two Business Days prior to publication of its
determination under clause 2.16C.10(b), notify the relevant Market
Participant of the determination; and

\(b\) publish on its website details of its determination, including the
name of the relevant Market Participant and the Irregular Price Offer to
which the determination relates.

2.16C.11. For the avoidance of doubt, the Economic Regulation Authority
may investigate any alleged breach of clause 2.16A.1, even if the
Economic Regulation Authority was not monitoring the Market
Participant’s price offers under clause 2.16C.4 at the time the alleged
breach occurred.

2.16D. Guidance, WEM Procedures and Consultation Framework

2.16D.1. The Economic Regulation Authority must develop, maintain and
publish on its website, the following guidelines:

\(a\) an Offer Construction Guideline that:

i\. provides guidance to Market Participants in relation to the price
offer obligations under clause 2.16A.1;

ii\. details how the Economic Regulation Authority will assess prices
offered under clause 2.16C.6;

iii\. permits the recovery of all efficient variable costs of producing
the relevant electricity, including all costs incurred under long-term
take-or-pay fuel contracts;

iv\. outlines how the Economic Regulation Authority will consider price
offers for different Facility types, including Electric Storage
Resources;

v\. provides examples illustrating the types of conduct that the
Economic Regulation Authority considers would be likely to contravene
the price offer obligations under clause 2.16A.1; and

vi\. provides guidance to Market Participants on how the Economic
Regulation Authority will assess inefficient market outcomes under
clause 2.16C.7; and

\(b\) a Trading Conduct Guideline that must provide clarity and guidance
to Market Participants regarding the prohibited conduct described in
clause 2.16A.3. The Trading Conduct Guideline must provide examples
illustrating the types of conduct that the Economic Regulation Authority
considers would be likely to contravene clause 2.16A.3.

2.16D.2. Subject to the provisions of this section 2.16D, the Economic
Regulation Authority may amend the guidelines to be developed and
maintained under clause 2.16D.1 at any time.

2.16D.3. In developing and maintaining the guidelines under clause
2.16D.1, or any amendments to them under clause 2.16D.2, the Economic
Regulation Authority must publish on its website:

\(a\) a draft report containing a copy of the proposed guidelines, or
the proposed amendments to the guidelines, as applicable, and a request
for submissions;

\(b\) the closing date for submissions, which must be no earlier than
four weeks after the date of publication of the draft report; and

\(c\) a copy of all submissions received provided that if a submission
contains information that the Economic Regulation Authority reasonably
considers to be confidential, the Economic Regulation Authority may
redact that information to the extent it considers appropriate.

2.16D.4. Following the closing date for submissions on the draft report
published under clause 2.16D.3, the Economic Regulation Authority must
publish a final report on its website containing:

\(a\) the final guidelines, or the amendments to the guidelines, as
applicable;

\(b\) where applicable, the reasons for the amendment to the guidelines;

\(c\) a summary of any submissions received by the Economic Regulation
Authority on the draft report published under clause 2.16D.3 that were
received within the time specified, and any late submissions the
Economic Regulation Authority has decided, in its discretion, to take
into account;

\(d\) the Economic Regulation Authority’s responses to the issues raised
in those submissions;

\(e\) any other matters the Economic Regulation Authority considers
relevant to the guidelines, or the amendment to the guidelines, as
applicable; and

\(f\) the date that the final guidelines, or the amendment to the
guidelines, will commence.

2.16D.5. A Market Participant that has received a notice from the
Economic Regulation Authority under clauses 2.16C.1(c)(ii) or 2.16C.2(d)
may, in accordance with clause 2.16D.6, request guidance from the
Economic Regulation Authority in relation to the Offer Construction
Guideline, including, for the purposes of the Economic Regulation
Authority's assessment of prices offered under clause 2.16C.6, how the
matters in the Offer Construction Guideline may apply to the Market
Participant's Registered Facility.

2.16D.6. A request made by a Market Participant under clause 2.16D.5
must:

\(a\) be in writing;

\(b\) identify the matters in the Offer Construction Guideline on which
the Market Participant is seeking guidance;

\(c\) specify the Market Participant's reasons for seeking guidance;

\(d\) where relevant, provide supporting materials that illustrate or

guidance on the matters specified in the request.

2.16D.8. The Economic Regulation Authority may request further
information from a Market Participant that has made a request under
clause 2.16D.5. If, within 15 Business Days of the date of the Economic
Regulation Authority's request for further information, the Market
Participant does not provide the information requested, or the Economic
Regulation Authority reasonably considers the information provided is
not satisfactory, the Market Participant will be deemed to have
withdrawn the relevant request.

2.16D.9. If the Economic Regulation Authority issues a request for
further information under clause 2.16D.8, the timeframe specified in
clause 2.16D.7 for the Economic Regulation Authority to provide the
relevant guidance will recommence from the date the Market Participant
has provided all of the further information requested by the Economic
Regulation Authority.

2.16D.10. The Economic Regulation Authority is not required to provide
guidance to a Market Participant in relation to a request under clause
2.16D.5 where it considers that:

\(a\) the Offer Construction Guideline already provides sufficient
guidance on the matters raised in the request;

\(b\) the request does not meet the requirements in clause 2.16D.6;

\(c\) the cost the Economic Regulation Authority would incur to provide
the guidance sought in the request is unreasonable or excessive; or

\(d\) the request is substantially similar to a previous request
considered by the Economic Regulation Authority from the same Market
Participant.

2.16D.11. Subject to clause 2.16D.12, any guidance provided by the
Economic Regulation Authority pursuant to clause 2.16D.7 is not binding
on the Economic Regulation Authority, the Market Participant who made
the request, or any other person, and the Economic Regulation Authority
may, at any time, reconsider, revise or withdraw any guidance provided
to a Market Participant.

2.16D.12. In conducting an investigation under clauses 2.16C.6 or
2.16C.7, the Economic Regulation Authority must take into account any
guidance it may have provided to the Market Participant under clause
2.16D.7 that is relevant to the matters being investigated.

2.16D.13. Where the Economic Regulation Authority provides guidance to a
Market Participant under clause 2.16D.7, the Economic Regulation
Authority must consider whether the Offer Construction Guideline should
be amended to reflect that guidance. Where the Economic Regulation
Authority considers the Offer Construction Guideline should be amended,
the Economic Regulation Authority must initiate an amendment to the
Offer Construction Guideline in accordance with clause 2.16D.3 as soon
as practicable.

2.16D.14. The Economic Regulation Authority must publish on its website
a copy of any guidance provided to a Market Participant under clause
2.16D.7 provided that the Economic Regulation Authority must first
redact all information that is confidential or commercially sensitive in
the guidance, including the name of the Market Participant to whom the
guidance was provided. Where the Economic Regulation Authority considers
the guidance cannot be redacted to ensure the identity of the Market
Participant to whom the guidance was provided remains confidential, the
Economic Regulation Authority is not required to publish the guidance.

2.16D.15. The Economic Regulation Authority must document in a WEM
Procedure:

\(a\) the methodologies and processes to be followed by the Economic
Regulation Authority in relation to:

required to be maintained or recorded by a Market Participant to enable
the Economic Regulation Authority to carry out its monitoring of price
offers under clause 2.16C.4; and

Market Participants must follow in respect to a request for guidance
under clause 2.16D.5, which may include a template that a Market
Participant must use for making a request.

2.16E. Irregular Price Offers – Limited Application of Section 2.13

2.16E.1. Subject to clauses 2.16C.6 and 2.16C.7, the Economic Regulation
Authority must not, in respect of a price offer described in clause
2.16C.4, investigate a Market Participant under clause 2.13.27, or take
enforcement action under clause 2.13.36 for a breach of clause 2.16A.1,
where the Economic Regulation Authority has determined under clause
2.16C.7 that an Irregular Price Offer by the Market Participant has not
resulted in an inefficient market outcome.

2.16E.2. Where the Economic Regulation Authority has determined that an
Irregular Price Offer by a Market Participant has not resulted in an
inefficient market outcome, the Economic Regulation Authority must
notify the Market Participant of the results of the investigation and

2.22A. Determination of AEMO's budget

2.22A.1. Subject to the requirements of this section 2.22A, AEMO may
recover its costs for performing its functions under the WEM Regulations
and the WEM Rules.

2.22A.2. For the Review Period, AEMO must seek the determination of its
Allowable Revenue and Forecast Capital Expenditure from the Economic
Regulation Authority for its functions, in accordance with the proposal
guideline referred to in clause 2.22A.9.

2.22A.2A. A submission by AEMO under clause 2.22A.2 must be made and
processed in accordance with the following timelines:

\(a\) by 31 October of the year prior to the start of the Review Period,
AEMO must submit a proposal for its Allowable Revenue and Forecast
Capital Expenditure over the Review Period to the Economic Regulation
Authority;

\(b\) by 31 March of the year in which the Review Period commences, the
Economic Regulation Authority must publish on its website a draft
determination of AEMO’s Allowable Revenue and Forecast Capital
Expenditure for the Review Period for public consultation;

\(c\) by 30 April of the year in which the Review Period commences, the
Economic Regulation Authority must prepare and publish on its website
its final determination of AEMO’s Allowable Revenue and Forecast Capital
Expenditure for the Review Period together with any submission received
in response to the draft determination published in accordance with
clause 2.22A.2A(b); and

\(d\) where the Economic Regulation Authority does not make a
determination by the date in clause 2.22A.2A(c) or clause 2.22A.2B(c),
the Market Participant Market Fee rate determined in accordance with
section 2.24 for the current Financial Year will continue to apply until
the Economic Regulation Authority makes a determination.

2.22A.2B. Notwithstanding clause 2.22A.2A, for the Review Period from 1
July 2022 to 1 July 2025 the following applies:

\(a\) the Economic Regulation Authority must publish a proposal
guideline by 31 October 2021;

\(b\) AEMO must submit a proposal for its Allowable Revenue and Forecast
Capital Expenditure to the Economic Regulation Authority for the Review
Period by 31 December 2021;

Expenditure for the Review Period for public consultation by 31 March
2022; and

\(d\) the Economic Regulation Authority must prepare and publish on its
website its final determination of AEMO’s Allowable Revenue and Forecast
Capital Expenditure for the Review Period by 31 May 2022.

2.22A.3. AEMO’s proposal under clauses 2.22A.2A(a) or 2.22A.2B(b) or
AEMO’s application for reassessment under clauses 2.22A.12 or 2.22A.13
must, to the extent practicable, identify proposed costs that are
associated with a specific project or where that is not practicable, one
or more specific functions.

2.22A.4. If AEMO appoints a Delegate, then its proposal for, or
application for reassessment of, its Allowable Revenue and Forecast
Capital Expenditure must separately itemise the amount payable to the
Delegate.

2.22A.5. The Economic Regulation Authority must take the following into
account when determining AEMO's Allowable Revenue and Forecast Capital
Expenditure or an application for reassessment to the Allowable Revenue
or Forecast Capital Expenditure:

\(a\) the Allowable Revenue must be sufficient to cover the forward
looking costs of performing AEMO’s functions in accordance with the
following principles:

i\. recurring expenditure requirements and payments are recovered in the
year of the expenditure; and

ii\. capital expenditure is to be recovered through the depreciation and
amortisation of the assets acquired by the capital expenditures in a
manner that is consistent with generally accepted accounting principles;

\(b\) the Allowable Revenue and Forecast Capital Expenditure must
include only costs which would be incurred by a prudent provider of the
services provided by AEMO in performing its functions, acting
efficiently, to achieve the lowest practicably sustainable cost of
performing AEMO’s functions, while effectively promoting the Wholesale
Market Objectives;

\(c\) where possible, the Economic Regulation Authority should benchmark
the Allowable Revenue and Forecast Capital Expenditure against the costs
of providing similar functions and/or projects in other jurisdictions;

\(d\) where costs incurred by AEMO relate to both the performance of
functions in connection with the WEM Rules, and the performance of
AEMO's other functions, the costs must be allocated on a fair and
reasonable basis between:

i\. costs recoverable as part of AEMO's Allowable Revenue and Forecast
Capital Expenditure; and

ii\. other costs not to be recovered under the WEM Rules; and

\(e\) any other matters the Economic Regulation Authority considers
relevant to its determination.

2.22A.6. The Economic Regulation Authority may do any or all of the
following in respect to AEMO’s proposal under clauses 2.22A.2A(a) or
2.22A.2B(b):

\(a\) approve the costs of any project;

\(b\) approve the costs of AEMO performing its functions;

\(c\) if the Economic Regulation Authority considers that some costs do
not meet the requirements of clause 2.22A.5, reject the costs fully or
partially, or substitute those costs with costs the Economic Regulation
Authority considers meets the requirements of clause 2.22A.5; and

\(d\) recommend to AEMO that some of the costs be considered in a
subsequent Review Period or in accordance with clause 2.22A.14.

2.22A.7. By 30 June each year, AEMO must publish on the WEM Website a
budget for the costs AEMO will incur in performing its functions for the
coming Financial Year (including, without limitation, the amount to be
paid to a Delegate). AEMO must ensure that its budget is:

\(a\) consistent with the Allowable Revenue and Forecast Capital
Expenditure determined by the Economic Regulation Authority for the
relevant Review Period and any reassessment; and

\(b\) reported in accordance with the Regulatory Reporting Guidelines
issued by the Economic Regulation Authority from time to time in
accordance with clause 2.22A.9.

2.22A.8. By 31 October each year, AEMO must publish on the WEM Website a
financial report showing AEMO's actual financial performance against its
budget for the previous Financial Year (including, without limitation,
the actual amount paid to a Delegate compared to the budgeted amount).
The report must be in accordance with the Regulatory Reporting
Guidelines issued by the Economic Regulation Authority from time to time
in accordance with clause 2.22A.9.

2.22A.9. The Economic Regulation Authority must issue guidelines,
following public consultation, in relation to this section 2.22A,
including:

\(a\) proposal guidelines, which must consider how future projects that
carry a risk of not proceeding or for which the associated costs are not
able to be quantified may be dealt with, and provide clarity and
guidance to AEMO and Market Participants regarding the level of detail
about projects, functions and costs expected in AEMO’s proposal; and

\(b\) regulatory reporting guidelines, which:

i\. must contain annual reporting obligations and provide clarity and
guidance to AEMO and Market Participants about the scope of reporting
and how AEMO should annually report to the Economic Regulation Authority
and Market Participants; and

ii\. are aimed at providing transparency and accountability in relation
to AEMO’s functions and Allowable Revenue and Forecast Capital
Expenditure.

2.22A.10. The Economic Regulation Authority may amend guidelines issued
under clause 2.22A.9 at any time, following public consultation which
allows a reasonable opportunity for relevant stakeholders to present
their views.

2.22A.11. Where the revenue earned for the functions performed by AEMO
via Market Fees in the previous Financial Year, is greater than or less
than AEMO's expenditure for that Financial Year, AEMO’s current year’s
budget must take into account any difference between AEMO’s Market Fees
revenue and AEMO’s expenditure in the previous Financial Year by:

\(a\) decreasing the budgeted revenue by the amount of any revenue
surplus; or

\(b\) increasing the budgeted revenue by the amount of any revenue
shortfall.

2.22A.12. Where, taking into account any adjustment under clause
2.22A.11, AEMO’s budget is likely to result in revenue recovery, over
the relevant Review Period, being at least the lower of 10% of the
Allowable Revenue or $10 million, greater than the Allowable Revenue
determined by the Economic Regulation Authority, AEMO must apply to the
Economic Regulation Authority to reassess the Allowable Revenue.

2.22A.13. AEMO must apply to the Economic Regulation Authority to
determine the adjusted Forecast Capital Expenditure for the current
Review Period if the capital expenditure, over the relevant Review
Period, is likely to be at least the lower of 10% of the Forecast
Capital Expenditure or $10 million, greater than the Forecast Capital
Expenditure determined by the Economic Regulation Authority.

2.22A.13A.If AEMO underspends on the Allowable Revenue and/or Forecast
Capital Expenditure determined by the Economic Regulation Authority in a
Review Period, then, for the next Review Period, the $10 million
threshold in clause 2.22A.13 is to be increased to the amount equal to
30 percent of the underspend plus $10 million.

2.22A.14. AEMO may apply to the Economic Regulation Authority, at any
time during a Review Period, for additional costs to be considered by
the Economic Regulation Authority as part of the Allowable Revenue and
Forecast Capital Expenditure for that Review Period:

\(a\) for the Allowable Revenue:

i\. costs previously rejected by the Economic Regulation Authority
pursuant to clause 2.22A.6;

ii\. new costs for new projects or new functions conferred on AEMO since
AEMO’s proposal for its Allowable Revenue for the current Review Period
was submitted; and

iii\. costs which were not able to be estimated with reasonable
confidence at the time the Allowable Revenue for the current Review
Period was submitted; and

\(b\) for the Forecast Capital Expenditure:

i\. costs previously rejected by the Economic Regulation Authority
pursuant to clause 2.22A.5;

ii\. new costs for new projects or new functions conferred on AEMO since
AEMO’s proposal for its Forecast Capital Expenditure for the current
Review Period was submitted; and

iii\. costs which were not able to be estimated with reasonable
confidence at the time of the Forecast Capital Expenditure for the
current Review Period was submitted.

2.22A.15. The Economic Regulation Authority may request information from
AEMO in relation to the performance of its functions under this section
2.22A. AEMO must provide the information to the Economic Regulation
Authority by the time specified in a request, which must be reasonable.

2.22A.16. AEMO must make an application under clauses 2.22A.12 or
2.22A.14(a) by 31 March for the Economic Regulation Authority to make a
determination before the commencement of the Financial Year to which it
relates.

2.22A.17. The Economic Regulation Authority may amend a determination
under clauses 2.22A.2A(c) or 2.22A.2B(d) if AEMO makes a reassessment
application under clauses 2.22A.12, 2.22A.13 or 2.22A.14 and the
Economic Regulation Authority:

\(a\) must take the matters referred to in clause 2.22A.5 into account
in determining any reassessment;

\(b\) may consider as part of its amended determination any earlier
determined costs where the Economic Regulation Authority reasonably
considers it necessary to review those earlier determined costs as part
of the reassessment;

\(c\) is not required to reassess earlier determined costs in making its
redetermination of the Allowable Revenue or Forecast Capital
Expenditure; and

\(d\) must complete such public consultation as the Economic Regulation
Authority considers appropriate in the circumstances.

2.23. \[Blank\]

2.24. Determination of Market Fees

2.24.1. The Market Fees charged by AEMO are:

\(a\) Market Participant Market Fees, Market Participant Coordinator
Fees and Market Participant Regulator Fees the rates of which are
determined in accordance with this section 2.24;

\(b\) Application Fees in accordance with section 2.33 and clauses
2.31.2, 4.9.3(c), 4.26.2CC and 4.28.9B; and

\(c\) a Reassessment Fee in accordance with clause 4.11.11.

2.24.2. Before 30 June each year, AEMO must determine and publish the
level of:

\(a\) the Market Participant Market Fee rate;

\(b\) the Market Participant Coordinator Fee rate;

\(c\) the Market Participant Regulator Fee rate;

\(d\) each Application Fee; and

\(e\) the Reassessment Fee,

to apply over the year starting 1 July in accordance with:

\(f\) AEMO’s budget published under clause 2.22A.7;

\(g\) information provided by the Economic Regulation Authority to AEMO
under clause 2.24.6 (if any); and

\(h\) information provided by the Coordinator to AEMO under clause
2.24.6A (if any).

Where the Economic Regulation Authority has not provided AEMO with the
information under, and by the time specified in clause 2.24.6, AEMO must
determine and publish the expected level of Market Participant Regulator
Fee rate based on the most recent information provided to AEMO by the
Economic Regulation Authority under clause 2.24.6. Where the Coordinator
has not provided AEMO with the information under, and by the time
specified in, clause 2.24.6A, AEMO must determine and publish the
expected level of Market Participant Coordinator Fee rate based on the
most recent information provided to AEMO by the Coordinator under clause
2.24.6A.

2.24.2A. AEMO must determine and publish a level of revised Market
Participant Coordinator Fee rate or Market Participant Regulator Fee
rate (as applicable), within five Business Days of:

\(a\) receiving the information under clause 2.24.6A from the
Coordinator after the timeframe specified in that clause; or

\(b\) receiving the information under clause 2.24.6 from the Economic
Regulation Authority after the timeframe specified in that clause.

2.24.2B. A revised Market Participant Coordinator Fee rate and Market
Participant Regulator Fee rate will supersede any expected Market
Participant Coordinator Fee rate and Market Participant Regulator Fee
rate and are recoverable from Market Participants in arrears with effect
from the start of the Financial Year to which they apply.

2.24.3. At the same time as AEMO publishes a level of revised Market
Participant Market Fee rate, Market Participant Coordinator Fee rate or
Market Participant Regulator Fee rate (as applicable), AEMO must also
publish an estimate of the total amount of revenue to be earned from:

\(a\) Market Participant Market Fees collected for AEMO's:

i\. market operation services;

ii\. system planning services;

iii\. market administration services; and

iv\. system management services,

where the amounts to be earned for each service is equal to the relevant
costs in AEMO’s budget published in accordance with clause 2.22A.7 or as
adjusted under clause 2.24.2A;

\(b\) Market Participant Coordinator Fees collected for:

i\. the Coordinator's functions under these WEM Rules;

ii\. the costs associated with the remuneration and other expenses for
the independent Chair of the Market Advisory Committee; and

iii\. in the Coordinator’s discretion, costs associated with the
remuneration and other expenses of the representatives of small-use
consumers on the Market Advisory Committee,

where the amount to be earned for those services is equivalent to the
costs identified by the Coordinator as costs incurred in the performance
of the Coordinator's functions under these WEM Rules or the WEM
Regulations, where the amount must be consistent with the relevant
amount notified to AEMO in accordance with clause 2.24.6A; and

\(c\) Market Participant Regulator Fees collected for the Economic
Regulation Authority’s monitoring, compliance, enforcement and
regulation services where the amount must be consistent with the
relevant amount notified to AEMO in accordance with clause 2.24.6.

2.24.4. The Market Participant Market Fee rate, Market Participant
Coordinator Fee rate and Market Participant Regulator Fee rate should be
set at a level that AEMO estimates will earn revenue equal to the
relevant estimate of revenue under clause 2.24.3.

2.24.5. The Economic Regulation Authority may recover a portion of its
budget determined by the Minister responsible for the Economic
Regulation Authority which corresponds to the costs of the Economic
Regulation Authority in undertaking its Wholesale Electricity Market
related functions and other functions under these WEM Rules and the WEM
Regulations from the collection of Market Participant Regulator Fees
under these WEM Rules. The Economic Regulation Authority must identify
in its budget the proportion of its costs that relate to the performance
of its Wholesale Electricity Market related functions and its other
functions.

2.24.5A. Where the revenue earned via Market Participant Regulator Fees
in the previous Financial Year is greater than or less than the Economic
Regulation Authority expenditure related to the functions described in
clause 2.24.5 for that Financial Year, the current year’s budget must
take this into account by decreasing the budgeted revenue by the amount
of the surplus or adding to the budgeted revenue the amount of any
shortfall, as the case may be.

2.24.5B. The Coordinator may recover a portion of her or his budget
determined by the Minister responsible for the Coordinator which
corresponds to the costs of the Coordinator in undertaking her or his
functions under these WEM Rules (including costs referred to in clause
2.24.3(b)) from the collection of Market Participant Coordinator Fees
under these WEM Rules.

2.24.5C. The Coordinator must:

\(a\) identify in her or his budget the proportion of her or his costs
that relate to the performance of her or his functions under these WEM
Rules; and

\(b\) subject to clause 2.24.5E, publish on the Coordinator’s Website
the proportion of costs corresponding to the functions described in
clause 2.2D.1.

2.24.5D. Where the revenue earned via Market Participant Coordinator
Fees in the previous Financial Year is greater than or less than the
Coordinator expenditure related to the functions described in clause
2.24.5B for that Financial Year, the current year’s budget must take
this into account by decreasing the budgeted revenue by the amount of
the surplus or adding to the budgeted revenue the amount of any
shortfall, as the case may be.

Market Price Limits, Reviews and Loss Factors

2.26. Economic Regulation Authority Reviews of Market Price Limits and
the Methodology for Setting the Benchmark Reserve Capacity Price

2.26.1. The Economic Regulation Authority must, in accordance with this
section 2.26, review the value of the Energy Offer Price Ceiling at
least once every three years. For the avoidance of doubt, the Economic
Regulation Authority must complete a subsequent review under this clause
2.26.1 and publish its final report no later than three years from the
date of publication of the final report from the preceding review.

2.26.2. In conducting a review pursuant to clause 2.26.1, the Economic
Regulation Authority must calculate the Energy Offer Price Ceiling by:

\(a\) applying the following formula:

> (1 + Risk Margin) × (Variable O&M +(Heat Rate × Fuel Cost))/Loss
> Factor
>
> where:

i\. Risk Margin is a measure of uncertainty in the assessment of the
mean short run average cost for the highest cost Facility in the SWIS,
expressed as a fraction;

ii\. Variable O&M is the mean variable operating and maintenance cost
for the highest cost Facility in the SWIS, expressed in $/MWh, and
includes, but is not limited to, start-up related costs;

iii\. Heat Rate is the mean heat rate at the minimum dispatchable
loading level specified in Standing Data for the highest cost Facility
in the SWIS, expressed in GJ/MWh;

iv\. Fuel Cost is the mean unit fixed and variable fuel cost for the
highest cost Facility in the SWIS, expressed in $/GJ; and

v\. Loss Factor is the marginal loss factor for the highest cost
Facility in the SWIS, relative to the Reference Node, determined in
accordance with section 2.27,

where the Economic Regulation Authority must determine the values for
each factor described in clauses 2.26.2(a)(i) to 2.26.2(a)(v)
consistently with the Offer Construction Guideline as it applies to the
highest cost generating Facility in the SWIS;

\(b\) rounding up the value in clause 2.26.2(a) to the nearest multiple
of $100/MWh; and

\(c\) determining whether an indexation process should apply to the
Energy Offer Price Ceiling to reflect movements in input costs and, if
so, determining the formula for the indexation calculation and the
frequency at which indexation will apply.

Review of FCESS Offer Price Ceilings

2.26.2A. The Economic Regulation Authority must, in accordance with this
section 2.26, review the value of the Contingency Reserve Raise Offer
Price Ceiling, Contingency Reserve Lower Offer Price Ceiling, RoCoF
Control Service Offer Price Ceiling, Regulation Raise Offer Price
Ceiling and Regulation Lower Offer Price Ceiling at least once every
three years. For the avoidance of doubt, the Economic Regulation
Authority must complete a subsequent review under this clause 2.26.2A of
an FCESS Offer Price Ceiling and publish its final report no later than
three years from the date of publication of the final report from the
preceding review of that FCESS Offer Price Ceiling.

2.26.2B. In conducting a review pursuant to clause 2.26.2A, the Economic
Regulation Authority must determine the value of each FCESS Offer Price
Ceiling by:

\(a\) estimating, consistently with the Offer Construction Guideline as
it applies to the highest cost Facility providing the relevant Frequency
Co-optimised Essential System Service in the SWIS, the variable costs of
providing the Frequency Co‑optimised Essential System Service that are
not compensated through other market mechanisms in the Wholesale
Electricity Market;

\(b\) rounding up its determination of the value of the FCESS Offer
Price Ceiling to the nearest multiple of $50 per MW per hour or $50 per
MWs per hour, as applicable; and

\(c\) determining whether an indexation process should apply to the
FCESS Offer Price Ceiling to reflect movements in input costs and, if
so, determining the formula for the indexation calculation and the
frequency at which indexation will apply.

Review of Energy Offer Price Floor

2.26.2C. The Economic Regulation Authority must, in accordance with this
section 2.26, review the appropriateness of the value of the Energy
Offer Price Floor at least once every three years. For the avoidance of
doubt, the Economic Regulation Authority must complete a subsequent
review under this clause 2.26.2C and publish its final report no later
than three years from the date of publication of the final report from
the preceding review.

2.26.2D. In conducting a review required by clause 2.26.2C, the Economic
Regulation Authority must apply the following principles:

\(a\) the Economic Regulation Authority must only revise the value of
the Energy Offer Price Floor if it determines that the current value of
the Energy Offer Price Floor is not appropriate under clause 2.26.2E;

\(b\) if the Economic Regulation Authority determines that the current
Energy Offer Price Floor is not appropriate under clause 2.26.2E, the
revised value for the Energy Offer Price Floor must:

i\. allow for the Real-Time Market for energy to clear without the
Reference Trading Price being equal to the Energy Offer Price Floor in
most circumstances; and

ii\. subject to clause 2.26.2D(b)(i), limit the exposure of Market
Participants to Reference Trading Prices that are reasonably likely to
materially adversely affect the financial viability of a prudent Market
Participant.

2.26.2E. In determining whether the current value of the Energy Offer
Price Floor is not appropriate for the purposes of clause 2.26.2D(a),
the Economic Regulation Authority must consider, without limitation, if,
since the previous review of the value of the Energy Offer Price Floor
under this section 2.26:

\(a\) the Real-Time Market for energy has cleared at the Energy Offer
Price Floor in one or more Dispatch Intervals due to, in the Economic
Regulation Authority’s reasonable opinion, the Energy Offer Price Floor
being too high; and

\(b\) there has been a change in the generation fleet in the SWIS that,
in the Economic Regulation Authority’s reasonable opinion, is likely to
result in:

i\. the current Energy Offer Price Floor being materially lower than
necessary to achieve the criterion in clause 2.26.2D(b)(i), including,
but not limited to, an upgrade or the retirement of a Facility with high
cycling costs; or

ii\. the current Energy Offer Price Floor being too high to achieve the
criterion in clause 2.26.2D(b)(i), including, but not limited to, the
increase of cycling costs due to deterioration or ageing of a Facility.

2.26.2F. When reviewing the Energy Offer Price Floor in accordance with
this section 2.26, if the Economic Regulation Authority determines under
clause 2.26.2E that the Energy Offer Price Floor is not appropriate, the
Economic Regulation Authority must:

\(a\) determine for credible scenarios of low demand, the price at which
the operator of the Facility with the highest cycling costs per MW in
the SWIS in the scenario would, acting reasonably, decommit the Facility
should the Reference Trading Price equal or fall below that price for a
single Trading Interval;

\(b\) revise the Energy Offer Price Floor to be the highest price
determined under the scenarios in clause 2.26.2F(a) that is lower than
95 percent of all of the prices determined under clause 2.26.2F(a); and

\(c\) determine whether an indexation process should apply to the Energy
Offer Price Floor to reflect movements in input costs and, if so,
determine the formula for the indexation calculation and the frequency
at which indexation will apply.

2.26.2G. When determining the credible scenarios of low demand for the
purpose of clause 2.26.2F(a), the Economic Regulation Authority may use
historic scenarios but must also account for any changes expected in the
SWIS that would take effect prior to the time that the Energy Offer
Price Floor would apply and that are likely to have an effect on the
Reference Trading Price. The changes include, but are not limited to:

\(a\) expected changes in system demand;

\(b\) any expected entrance of a new Facility that will participate in
the Real-Time Market;

\(c\) expected changes to an existing Facility; and

\(d\) any expected permanent exit of a Facility from the Real-Time
Market.

2.26.2H. When determining the cycling costs of a Facility under clause
2.26.2F(a), the Economic Regulation Authority must consider:

\(a\) the factors that a Market Participant acting reasonably would
consider in making a decommitment decision for the Facility with the
highest cycling costs in the SWIS, assuming that all energy sent out by
the Facility is settled at the Reference Trading Price, including:

i\. the cost to decommit and recommit within the timeframe specified
under clause 2.26.2H(a)(iii), including start-related fuel costs and
variable operating and maintenance costs of the Facility;

ii\. the minimum stable level of operation of the Facility;

iii\. the minimum time the Facility must remain out of service once
decommitted before recommitment is possible; and

iv\. any expected losses or gains, opportunity costs and cost savings
that the Market Participant would incur as a result of decommitment for
the duration of the minimum time the Facility must remain out of service
before recommitment is possible; and

\(b\) any other matters that the Economic Regulation Authority considers
relevant.

2.26.2I. When determining the cycling costs of a Facility under clause
2.26.2F(a), the Economic Regulation Authority must have regard to the
Wholesale Market Objectives and must, as far as practicable, use
information about the costs the relevant Facility would incur as
provided by the relevant Market Participant but may use estimates where
the Economic Regulation Authority considers it to be reasonable.

2.26.2J. A Market Participant may, by the time specified for the close
of submissions under clause 2.26.2L(b), provide evidence to the Economic
Regulation Authority of the costs that a Facility incurs when
decommitting for the purpose of the WEM Rules and which the Economic
Regulation Authority must consider in determining the appropriateness of
the value of the Energy Offer Price Floor under clause 2.26.2C.

2.26.2K. Where a Market Participant provides the Economic Regulation
Authority with satisfactory evidence under clause 2.26.2J, the Economic
Regulation Authority must consider the information when determining the
appropriateness of the Energy Offer Price Floor as far as the
information affects the Economic Regulation Authority’s reasonable
estimate of any costs that a prudent Market Participant would incur when
decommitting its Facility in the scenarios under clause 2.26.2F(a).

Conducting a Review of a Market Price Limit

2.26.2L. In conducting a review of a Market Price Limit under clauses
2.26.1, 2.26.2A or 2.26.2C, the Economic Regulation Authority must
publish on its website:

\(a\) a draft report and a request for submissions;

\(b\) the closing date for submissions, which must be no earlier than
four weeks after the date of publication of the draft report; and

\(c\) a copy of all submissions received provided that if a submission
contains information that the Economic Regulation Authority reasonably
considers to be confidential, the Economic Regulation Authority may
redact that information to the extent it considers appropriate.

2.26.2M. Following the closing date for submissions on the draft report
published under clause 2.26.2L, the Economic Regulation Authority must
publish a final report on its website containing:

\(a\) the issues identified by the Economic Regulation Authority;

\(b\) the assumptions made by the Economic Regulation Authority in
undertaking the review;

\(c\) the Economic Regulation Authority’s determination of the relevant
Market Price Limit, which is to include, where applicable:

i\. the revised value of the relevant Market Price Limit;

ii\. the Trading Day from which the revised value of the relevant Market
Price Limit will take effect, which must be at least five Business Days
after the date the final report is published; and

iii\. any indexation process in the value of the relevant Market Price
Limit and the associated times each indexed value will apply from;

\(d\) how the Economic Regulation Authority determined the revised value
of the relevant Market Price Limit, including any analysis and
calculation parameters used in its determination;

\(e\) a summary of any submissions received by the Economic Regulation
Authority on the draft report published under clause 2.26.2L that were
received within the time specified, and any late submissions the
Economic Regulation Authority has decided, in its discretion, to take
into account;

\(f\) the Economic Regulation Authority’s responses to the issues raised
in those submissions; and

\(g\) any other matters the Economic Regulation Authority considers
relevant to the review.

2.26.2N. Where a Rule Participant considers there has been a material
change in circumstances since the Economic Regulation Authority's most
recent review of a Market Price Limit pursuant to clauses 2.26.1,
2.26.2A or 2.26.2C, as applicable, the Rule Participant may, subject to
clause 2.26.2O(a), notify the Economic Regulation Authority that it
considers the Market Price Limit is no longer appropriate in accordance
with clause 2.26.2O.

2.26.2NA. If a Rule Participant considers there has been a material
change in market circumstances since the Economic Regulation Authority's
most recent review of a Market Price Limit pursuant to clauses 2.26.1,
2.26.2A or 2.26.2C, as applicable, the Rule Participant may, subject to
clause 2.26.2O(a), notify the Economic Regulation Authority that it
considers that for the Market Price Limit, the determination to apply or
not apply indexation to the Market Price Limit is no longer appropriate
in accordance with clause 2.26.2O.

2.26.2O. A notice by a Rule Participant under clauses 2.26.2N or
2.26.2NA must:

\(a\) be given no earlier than six months after completion of the most
recent review of the relevant Market Price Limit by the Economic
Regulation Authority under clauses 2.26.1, 2.26.2A or 2.26.2C, as
applicable; and

\(b\) set out the Rule Participant’s reasoning, with any supporting
analysis, as to why it considers there has been:

> i\. a material change in circumstances such that the relevant Market
> Price Limit is no longer appropriate, having regard to the relevant
> matters in this section 2.26; or
>
> ii\. a material change in market circumstances such that the
> determination to apply or not apply indexation to a Market Price Limit
> is no longer appropriate.

2.26.2P. Following receipt of a notice under clause 2.26.2N, the
Economic Regulation Authority must, as soon as practicable:

\(a\) after considering the information in the notice, determine whether
it considers it is appropriate to bring forward the next required review
of the relevant Market Price Limit under clauses 2.26.1, 2.26.2A or
2.26.2C, as applicable;

\(b\) in making its determination under clause 2.26.2P(a), have regard
to the Wholesale Market Objectives and any benefits of undertaking an
earlier review; and

\(c\) publish its response to the notice on its website, which is to
include details of whether a review of the relevant Market Price Limit
will be progressed, the proposed timing for the review, and the reasons
for its decision.

2.26.2Q. If the Economic Regulation Authority decides to bring forward a
review of a Market Price Limit pursuant to clause 2.26.2P(a), the
Economic Regulation Authority must use its best endeavours to conduct
the review in accordance with the proposed timing published in its
response to the relevant notice in accordance with clause 2.26.2P(c).

2.26.2R. In conducting a review of a Market Price Limit under clauses
2.26.1, 2.26.2A or 2.26.2C, the Economic Regulation Authority may
request information from a Market Participant.

2.26.2S. An information request by the Economic Regulation Authority
under clause 2.26.2R must specify the time by which the information
specified in the request must be provided by the Market Participant,
which must be at least 10 Business Days after the date of the request
and be reasonable having regard to the nature of the information
requested.

2.26.2T. Following receipt of a request under clause 2.26.2R, the Market
Participant must provide the information specified in the request by the
time specified in the request.

2.26.2U. Where the Economic Regulation Authority determines under
clauses 2.26.2(c), 2.26.2B(c) or 2.26.2F(c) that indexation in the value
of a Market Price Limit will apply, the Economic Regulation Authority
must:

\(a\) calculate each indexed value for the Market Price Limit in
accordance with the process and schedule determined under clause
2.26.2M(c)(iii); and

\(b\) for each indexed value calculated under clause 2.26.2U(a):

i\. publish on its website the indexed value and the Trading Day from
which the indexed value will take effect; and

ii\. notify AEMO of the publication of the indexed value,

at least five Business Days before the Trading Day from which the
indexed value will take effect.

2.26.2V. A revised value for a Market Price Limit replaces the previous
value after the Economic Regulation Authority has published its final
report in accordance with clause 2.26.2M, with effect from the Trading
Day specified in the final report or, in the case of an indexed value,
the Trading Day published by the Economic Regulation Authority on its
website in accordance with clause 2.26.2U.

2.26.2W. AEMO must publish on the WEM Website each revised value of a
Market Price Limit and the Trading Day from which the revised value will
take effect within five Business Days after the Economic Regulation
Authority publishes the relevant information under clauses 2.26.2M(c) or
2.26.2U(b).

2.26.3. At least once in every five years, the Economic Regulation
Authority must review the methodology for setting the Benchmark Reserve
Capacity Price. A review must examine:

\(a\) the appropriateness of the parameters and methodology in section
4.16 and the WEM Procedure referred to in clause 4.16.3 for
recalculating the Benchmark Reserve Capacity Price; and

\(b\) any other matters which the Economic Regulation Authority
considers relevant.

2.27. Determination of Loss Factors

2.27.1. Network Operators must, in accordance with this section 2.27,
calculate and provide to AEMO Loss Factors for:

\(a\) each connection point in their Networks at which any of the
following is connected:

i\. a Scheduled Facility;

iA. a Semi-Scheduled Facility;

ii\. a Non-Scheduled Facility; or

iii\. \[Blank\]

iv\. \[Blank\]

v\. a Non-Dispatchable Load equipped with an interval meter; and

\(b\) in the case of Western Power, the Notional Wholesale Meter.

2.27.2. A Market Participant may request, during the process of
obtaining a relevant Arrangement for Access, that the relevant Network
Operator determine and provide to AEMO Loss Factors to apply to a
Facility where there are no Loss Factors applying to the connection
point at which the Facility will be connected.

2.27.3. Loss Factors must reflect transmission and distribution losses
and each Loss Factor must be expressed as the product of a Transmission
Loss Factor and a Distribution Loss Factor.

2.27.4. Subject to clause 2.27.5(d), for each Network Operator AEMO
must, in consultation with that Network Operator, develop a
classification system to assign each of the connection points in the
Network Operator’s Network identified under clause 2.27.1(a) to a
Transmission Loss Factor Class and a Distribution Loss Factor Class,
where:

\(a\) the assignment of a connection point to a Loss Factor Class is
based on characteristics indicative of the expected transmission or
distribution system losses (as applicable) for the connection point;

\(b\) each connection point in a Loss Factor Class is assigned the same
Transmission Loss Factor or Distribution Loss Factor (as applicable);
and

\(c\) connection points on the transmission system are assigned to a
Distribution Loss Factor Class with a Distribution Loss Factor equal to
one.

2.27.5. In calculating Loss Factors, Network Operators must apply the
following principles:

\(a\) Transmission Loss Factors must notionally represent the marginal
transmission system losses for a connection point relative to the
Reference Node, averaged over all Trading Intervals in a year, weighted
by the absolute value of the net demand at that connection point during
the Trading Interval;

\(b\) Distribution Loss Factors must notionally represent the average
distribution system losses for a connection point over a year;

\(c\) Loss Factors must be calculated using:

i\. generation and load meter data from the preceding 12 months; or

ii\. for a new Facility, any other relevant data provided to the Network
Operator by the Market Participant and as agreed with the Network
Operator and AEMO; and

iii\. for Transmission Loss Factors, an appropriate network load flow
software package;

\(d\) a specific Loss Factor must be calculated for each:

i\. Scheduled Facility;

iA. Semi-Scheduled Facility;

ii\. Non-Scheduled Facility; and

iii\. \[Blank\]

iv\. \[Blank\]

v\. Non-Dispatchable Load above 7000 kVA peak consumption;

\(e\) Western Power must assign the Notional Wholesale Meter to:

i\. a Transmission Loss Factor Class that represents system wide average
marginal losses over Western Power’s transmission system; and

ii\. a Distribution Loss Factor Class that represents the average losses
incurred over Western Power’s distribution system by Non-Dispatchable
Loads not equipped with an interval meter; and

\(f\) the Transmission Loss Factors calculated for each Transmission
Loss Factor Class and the Distribution Loss Factors calculated for each
Distribution Loss Factor Class are static, and apply to each connection
point in the relevant Loss Factor Class until the time published by AEMO
under clause 2.27.8 for the application of an updated Transmission Loss
Factor or Distribution Loss Factor to that Loss Factor Class.

2.27.5A. For each Interruptible Load, AEMO must use a Loss Factor of 1.

2.27.6. Each year by 1 June each Network Operator must, in accordance
with the WEM Procedure specified in clause 2.27.17, recalculate the Loss
Factors for its connection points and provide AEMO with updated
Transmission Loss Factors and Distribution Loss Factors (as applicable)
for each Loss Factor Class in the Network Operator’s classification
system.

2.27.7. AEMO must publish the Transmission Loss Factors and Distribution
Loss Factors provided by a Network Operator in accordance with clause
2.27.6 within two Business Days after receiving them.

2.27.8. When Transmission Loss Factors and Distribution Loss Factors are
published in accordance with clause 2.27.7 or where one or more
Transmission Loss Factors or Distribution Loss Factors are changed in
accordance with clauses 2.27.15(e) or 2.27.16 AEMO must publish the time
from which the new Transmission Loss Factors or Distribution Loss
Factors will apply, where this must be from the commencement of a
Trading Day.

2.27.9. In setting the time from which a Transmission Loss Factor or
Distribution Loss Factor will apply in accordance with clause 2.27.8
AEMO must allow sufficient time for Rule Participants to identify and
update any submission or forecast data that is dependent on Loss
Factors.

2.27.10. A Network Operator must develop new Loss Factor Classes if
required to implement the classification system prescribed by AEMO for
that Network Operator. If a Network Operator develops a new Loss Factor
Class then it must:

\(a\) calculate the initial Transmission Loss Factor or Distribution
Loss Factor (as applicable) for the new Loss Factor Class in accordance
with the WEM Procedure specified in clause 2.27.17; and

\(b\) provide to AEMO details of the new Loss Factor Class and its
initial Transmission Loss Factor or Distribution Loss Factor as soon as
practicable but before a connection point is assigned to the new Loss
Factor Class.

2.27.11. AEMO must publish a new Transmission Loss Factor or
Distribution Loss Factor provided by a Network Operator in accordance
with clause 2.27.10(b) within two Business Days after receiving it from
the Network Operator.

Class and Distribution Loss Factor Class for each new connection point
in its Network identified under clause 2.27.1(a), in accordance with the
classification system prescribed by AEMO for that Network Operator.

2.27.13. A Network Operator must re-determine the Loss Factor Classes
for a connection point in its Network identified under clause 2.27.1(a)
if a change occurs to the connection point that might alter its
applicable Loss Factor Classes under the classification system
prescribed by AEMO for that Network Operator.

2.27.14. When a Network Operator determines a Loss Factor Class for a
connection point under clause 2.27.12 or changes a Loss Factor Class for
a connection point under clause 2.27.13, the Network Operator must
provide to both AEMO and the relevant Market Participant the new Loss
Factor Class for the connection point and the Trading Day from which it
takes effect, as soon as practicable but before the information is
required for use in calculations under the WEM Rules.

2.27.15. A Market Participant may apply to AEMO for a reassessment of
any Transmission Loss Factor or Distribution Loss Factor applying to a
Scheduled Facility, Semi-Scheduled Facility, Non-Scheduled Facility or
Non-Dispatchable Load registered to that Market Participant. The
following requirements apply to each application for reassessment:

\(a\) The Market Participant must apply for reassessment in accordance
with the WEM Procedure specified in clause 2.27.17.

\(b\) AEMO must process an application for reassessment and where
required conduct an audit of the relevant Loss Factor calculation in
accordance with the WEM Procedure specified in clause 2.27.17.

\(c\) The relevant Network Operator must cooperate with an audit of the
Loss Factor calculation conducted by AEMO under clause 2.27.15(b) by
providing reasonable access to the data and calculations used in
producing the Loss Factor.

\(d\) Where an audit reveals an error in the calculation of a
Transmission Loss Factor or Distribution Loss Factor for a Loss Factor
Class, AEMO must direct the Network Operator to recalculate the
Transmission Loss Factor or Distribution Loss Factor, and may instruct
the Network Operator to recalculate other Transmission Loss Factors or
Distribution Loss Factors provided by that Network Operator.

\(e\) Where AEMO directs the Network Operator to recalculate a
Transmission Loss Factor or Distribution Loss Factor for a Loss Factor
Class, then the Network Operator must do so, and must provide the
recalculated Transmission Loss Factor or Distribution Loss Factor to
AEMO. The recalculated Transmission Loss Factor or Distribution Loss
Factor is substituted for the value previously applied with effect from
the time published by AEMO in accordance with clause 2.27.8.

\(f\) Where an audit reveals an error in the assignment of a connection
point to a Loss Factor Class, AEMO must direct the relevant Network
Operator to correct the error and re-determine the Loss Factor Class for
the connection point in accordance with the classification system
prescribed by AEMO for that Network Operator.

\(g\) Where AEMO directs a Network Operator to re-determine a Loss
Factor Class for a connection point, then the Network Operator must do
so, and must as soon as reasonably practicable provide to AEMO and the
relevant Market Participant the revised Loss Factor Class and the
Trading Day from which it should apply.

\(h\) The costs of an audit conducted by AEMO in response to an
application for reassessment, including any costs incurred by the
Network Operator and any costs, not otherwise included in AEMO’s budget,
incurred by AEMO, are payable by the Market Participant who made the
application for reassessment, unless the audit reveals:

i\. an error of more than 0.0025 in the calculation of a Transmission
Loss Factor or Distribution Loss Factor; or

ii\. an incorrect assignment of a Connection Point to a Loss Factor
Class,

in which case all costs are payable by the relevant Network Operator.

2.27.16. Where a Network Operator fails to provide AEMO with a
Transmission Loss Factor or Distribution Loss Factor in accordance with
clause 2.27.6 or 2.27.15(d), AEMO must continue to use the equivalent
Transmission Loss Factor or Distribution Loss Factor from the previous
year until such time as the Network Operator has provided AEMO with the
new Transmission Loss Factor or Distribution Loss Factor and that
Transmission Loss Factor or Distribution Loss Factor has taken effect.
The recalculated Transmission Loss Factor or Distribution Loss Factor is

2.28. Rule Participants

2.28.1. The classes of Rule Participant are:

\(a\) Network Operator;

\(b\) Market Participant; and

\(c\) AEMO.

2.28.2. Subject to clauses 2.28.3 and 2.28.16, a person who owns,
controls or operates a transmission system or distribution system which
forms part of the South West Interconnected System, or is electrically
connected to that system, must register as a Rule Participant in the
Network Operator class.

2.28.3. A person that owns, controls or operates a transmission system
or distribution system may, but is not required to, register as a Rule
Participant in the Network Operator class where both the following are
satisfied:

\(a\) AEMO has determined that it does not require information about the
relevant network to ensure Power System Security and Power System
Reliability are maintained; and

\(b\) no Registered Facilities owned or operated by a Market Participant
are directly connected to the transmission system or distribution
system.

2.28.3A. A Network Operator must:

\(a\) promptly provide to AEMO all data available to it and reasonably
required to model the static and dynamic performance of the SWIS,
including (without limitation) computer models of the performance of the
Network and Facilities connected, or which may be connected in the
future, to the Network;

\(b\) promptly forward to AEMO subsequent updates of the data referred
to in clause 2.28.3A(a);

\(c\) use its reasonable endeavours to ensure that all data referred to
in this clause 2.28.3A is complete, current and accurate;

\(d\) promptly notify AEMO if there are any reasonable grounds for
suspecting that the data provided under this clause 2.28.3A is no longer
complete, current and accurate; and

\(e\) include as part of the data provided to AEMO under this clause
2.28.3A:

i\. all data provided to the Network Operator that is used for the
purpose of modelling in relation to the SWIS by Market Participants,
other generators, customers and storage providers, other Network
Operators and any other source;

ii\. all data relating to actual, committed or proposed modifications to
the SWIS that the Network Operator reasonably considers are relevant to
modelling in relation to the SWIS; and

iii\. data relating to any Facility with a System Size which is less
than 10 MW and is likely to be subject to constraints that may affect
Power System Security and Power System Reliability.

2.28.3B. Where AEMO:

\(a\) is satisfied that the performance of a Facility (or equipment
within the Facility) is not adequately represented by any applicable
data either provided under clause 2.28.3A or as part of a Registered
Generator Performance Standard; and

\(b\) holds the reasonable opinion that the inadequacy of the applicable
data, is or will impede AEMO's ability to carry out its functions in
relation to Power System Security and Power System Reliability,

AEMO may:

\(c\) where that Facility is not required to comply with the
requirements under clause 3A.2.2, request that the Network Operator
provide to AEMO, as soon as reasonably practicable, revised or
additional data and an associated model validation report demonstrating
to AEMO’s reasonable satisfaction that the performance of the Facility
(or equipment within the Facility) has been tested and is performing
substantially in accordance with the revised modelling data; and

\(d\) direct the relevant Market Participant, or Network Operator where
relevant, to operate the Facility (or equipment within the Facility) at
a particular level of output or in a particular manner, until either the
Market Participant is compliant with clause 3A.2.2 or until the Network
Operator has submitted revised data and an associated model validation
report under clause 2.28.3B(c), and AEMO is satisfied that the
performance of the Facility (or equipment within the Facility) is
performing substantially in accordance with that data.

2.28.4. A person who intends to own, control or operate a transmission
system or distribution system which will form part of the South West
Interconnected System, or will be electrically connected to that system,
may register as a Rule Participant in the Network Operator class.

<th><p><strong>Explanatory Note</strong></p>
<p>Clause 2.30.5(c) is a consequential amendment as a result of the new
Essential System Services framework, which does not use the term
‘Ancillary Service Contract’.</p>
<p>Clause 2.30.5(f) precludes AEMO from aggregating, or allowing to
continue to be aggregated, Facilities where the price for Reserve
Capacity to be provided by those Facilities is not, or is not expected
to be, the same.</p>
<p>Section 3.1.1 of the Energy Scheduling and Dispatch Information paper
sets out the criteria that AEMO must apply when approving the
aggregation of Facilities, so that the locational dispatch and
co-optimisation of ESS envisaged by the SCED reforms can be
effected.</p>
<p>Paragraph (g) of clause 2.30.5 represents this intent, and is
intended to convey the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>AEMO cannot approve an aggregation that would lead to the
over-procurement of Contingency Reserve Raise ESS as a result of
reflecting the output of the Aggregated Facility as the contingency (in
the relevant ESS constraint) in SCED when the credible contingency is
the individual loss of each component Facility. This is not an issue
when the aggregation is so small, that the impact on Contingency Reserve
Raise ESS procurement is negligible or nil.</p></li>
<li><p>AEMO cannot approve an aggregation where the Aggregated Facility
would be providing ESS, and the ESS capability (ESS trapezium) cannot be
accurately depicted for the Aggregated Facility in its entirety. It
should be noted the Facility capable of providing ESS, must offer its
ESS quantity at its connection points for the whole Facility, not at the
Facility’s sub-component level.</p></li>
<li><p>AEMO may only aggregate Facilities if the proposed Aggregated
Facility are at the same Electrical Location. Figure 1 and Figure 2
below illustrate configurations in which aggregation is allowed and not
allowed.</p></li>

Different Electrical Locations.</p>
<p><img src="media/image2.png"
style="width:5.95583in;height:3.91667in" /></p>
<p>In addition, clause 2.30.5 (b) has been amended slightly to clarify
the fact that:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The aggregation may comprise both registered and unregistered
Facilities; and</p></li>
<li><p>AEMO may require Standing Data in respect of the aggregation as
opposed to just the individual Facilities comprising the
aggregation.</p></li>

2.30.5. AEMO must only allow the aggregation of Facilities pursuant to
an application under clause 2.30.1 if, in its opinion, the proposed
Aggregated Facility meets the following criteria:

\(a\) the proposed Aggregated Facility will not adversely impact on
AEMO's ability to ensure Power System Security and Power System
Reliability are maintained;

\(b\) the Market Participant for the proposed Aggregated Facility
provides Standing Data for:

i\. each individual Facility that would be required to be provided if
each Facility was registered separately; and

ii\. the Aggregated Facility as a whole;

\(c\) adequate control and monitoring equipment exists for the proposed
Aggregated Facility; and

\(d\) the Facilities within the proposed Aggregated Facility are at the
same Electrical Location;

\(e\) \[Blank\]

\(f\) the Facility Monthly Reserve Capacity Price applicable to each of
the Facilities within the proposed Aggregated Facility is the same, and
is expected to remain the same, from and including the current Reserve
Capacity Cycle;

\(g\) either:

i\. the System Size of the proposed Aggregated Facility as determined by
AEMO will not affect the quantity of Frequency Co-optimised Essential
Services required to be dispatched; or

ii\. the Facility Contingency associated with the proposed Aggregated
Facility affects each individual Facility in the proposed aggregation
simultaneously;

\(h\) if the proposed Aggregated Facility intends to provide Frequency
Co-optimised Essential System Services, the capability to simultaneously
provide energy and Frequency Co-optimised Essential Services from the
individual Facilities in the proposed aggregation can be adequately
derived for the proposed Aggregated Facility; and

\(a\) an Energy Producing System must have the following
characteristics:

i\. it can typically supply the maximum quantity of energy consumed by
that Load to be treated as Intermittent Load without requiring energy to
be withdrawn from a Network; and

ii\. the output of which is netted off consumption of the Load by the
meter measuring consumption of the Load, or which is always or at times
electrically connected to the Load behind two or more shared network
connection points;

\(b\) the Intermittent Load shall reasonably be expected to have net
consumption of energy (based on Metered Schedules calculated in
accordance with the methodology prescribed in clauses 2.30B.10 or
2.30B.11) for not more than 4320 Trading Intervals in any Capacity Year,
excluding Trading Intervals in which the Facility containing the Load is
delivering a service under an NCESS Contract;

\(c\) the Market Participant for the Facility containing the Load must
have an agreement in place with a Network Operator to allow energy to be
supplied to the Load from a Network;

\(d\) \[Blank\]

\(e\) the Facility containing the Load is not expected (based on
applications accepted by AEMO under clause 2.29.5D and any amendments
accepted by AEMO under clause 2.29.5K) to be associated with any Demand
Side Programme for any period following the registration of the Load or
part of the Load as an Intermittent Load; and

Electricity Review Board has made a decision in accordance with the
Regulations that a Rule Participant be suspended, the Economic
Regulation Authority must notify AEMO and AEMO must issue a Suspension
Notice to the Rule Participant.

2.32.2. Where AEMO has issued a Suspension Notice pursuant to a
notification by the Economic Regulation Authority in accordance with
clause 2.32.1 that a Rule Participant be suspended, AEMO must publish a
notice on the WEM Website and issue a Market Advisory specifying that
the Rule Participant has been suspended from the Wholesale Electricity
Market and provide details of the suspension, including the reason for
the suspension and the date the suspension took effect.

2.32.2A. If a Suspension Notice is withdrawn, AEMO must promptly publish
a notice on the WEM Website and issue a Market Advisory specifying that
the Suspension Notice has been withdrawn.

2.32.3 AEMO may specify in a Suspension Notice directions that the
relevant Rule Participant must comply with to give effect to the
suspension.

2.32.4. From the time AEMO issues a Suspension Notice to a Rule
Participant:

\(a\) the Rule Participant must comply with the Suspension Notice,
including:

i\. trading or ceasing trading in the Wholesale Electricity Market to
the extent specified in the notice; and

ii\. continuing to meet any existing Reserve Capacity Obligations
specified in the notice.

\(b\) AEMO may do all or any of the following to give effect to the
notice:

Participant, and cancel any existing submissions; and

ii\. withhold payments owed to a defaulting Rule Participant.

2.32.5. AEMO must withdraw a Suspension Notice where:

\(a\) if the notice was issued under section 9.19, the defaulting Rule
Participant has remedied the relevant suspension event and is complying
with its Prudential Obligations; and

\(b\) if the notice was issued under clause 2.32.1, it receives a
further notice that the Electricity Review Board has withdrawn the
suspension,

and no other circumstances exist that would entitle AEMO to issue a
Suspension Notice.

2.32.6. Where a Rule Participant has been suspended for 90 days AEMO
must notify the Economic Regulation Authority and, the Economic
Regulation Authority may apply to the Electricity Review Board for a
de-registration order in accordance with the Regulations.

2.32.7. Where the Economic Regulation Authority receives notice that the
Electricity Review Board has made a decision in accordance with the
Regulations that a Rule Participant be de-registered, the relevant Rule
Participant ceases to be a Rule Participant from the time specified in

Correction Notice where a Rule Participant no longer legally exists
(e.g. liquidated) or is under administration. Currently, section 2.32
only provides AEMO with the head of power to issue a Suspension Notice
and/or a Registration Correction Notice to the Rule Participant, but
does not clearly address situations where the legal entity no longer

2.32.7BA. If AEMO becomes aware that a Rule Participant has become a
Chapter 5 body corporate (as defined in the Corporations Act), or is
under a similar form of administration under any laws applicable to it
in any jurisdiction, then AEMO must, as applicable:

\(a\) where AEMO intends to issue a Suspension Notice, issue the
Suspension Notice to the Chapter 5 body corporate and the External
Administrator, which may include directions that would have given in a
notice to the relevant Rule Participant pursuant to clause 2.32.1; or

\(b\) where AEMO intends to issue a Registration Correction Notice,
issue the Registration Correction Notice to the Chapter 5 body corporate
and the External Administrator, specifying details that it would have
specified in a notice to the relevant Rule Participant pursuant to
clause 2.32.7C; or

\(c\) notify the Economic Regulation Authority that the Rule Participant
is a Chapter 5 body corporate or has had an External Administrator
appointed, and that AEMO is not required to, as applicable:

i\. issue a Suspension Notice to the Rule Participant pursuant to clause
2.32.1; or

ii\. issue a Registration Correction Notice to the Rule Participant
pursuant to clause 2.32.7B(b).

2.32.7BB. If AEMO becomes aware that a Rule Participant has been wound
up or dissolved (as defined in the Corporations Act), AEMO:

\(a\) is not required to issue a Suspension Notice to the Rule
Participant pursuant to clause 2.32.1;

\(b\) is not required to issue a Registration Correction Notice to the
Rule Participant pursuant to clause 2.32.7B(b);

registered by or to the Rule Participant on a date and time nominated by
AEMO;

\(d\) must, as soon as practicable, notify the Economic Regulation
Authority that the Rule Participant has been wound up or dissolved; and

\(e\) must, as soon as practicable, publish a notice on the WEM Website
and issue a Market Advisory specifying that the Rule Participant will
cease, or has ceased, to be registered from the date and time nominated
by AEMO.

2.32.7C. Each Registration Correction Notice must:

\(a\) specify which of the criteria specified in clause 2.28.19 AEMO
considers the Rule Participant no longer meets;

\(b\) require that the Rule Participant:

i\. correct the circumstances that have led to it no longer meeting all
of the criteria specified in clause 2.28.19 and provide evidence to AEMO
that it has done so; or

ii\. provide evidence to AEMO that it continues to meet all of the
criteria specified in clause 2.28.19;

\(c\) specify a date and time for the Rule Participant to respond to the
Registration Correction Notice, which must be at least 90 days from the
date of the Registration Correction Notice; and

\(d\) specify a date and time from which the de-registration of the Rule
Participant will become effective, should that Rule Participant not
provide evidence in response to the Registration Correction Notice that
is satisfactory to AEMO.

2.32.7D. Where AEMO has issued a Registration Correction Notice it may
extend the deadline for:

\(a\) correcting the circumstances that are the subject of the notice;
or

\(b\) responding to the notice

for any period that it considers is appropriate in the circumstances.

2.32.7E. AEMO must consider any evidence or submissions provided by a
Rule Participant in response to a Registration Correction Notice and
determine whether:

\(a\) it is satisfied that the Rule Participant meets all of the
criteria specified in clause 2.28.19. If so, AEMO will notify the Rule
Participant that no further action will be taken; or

\(b\) it is not satisfied that the Rule Participant meets all of the
criteria specified in clause 2.28.19. If so, AEMO will issue a
De-registration Notice notifying the Rule Participant that it will cease
to be registered from the date and time specified in the De-registration
Notice and the Rule Participant will cease to be registered with effect
from that date and time.

2.32.7F. Where AEMO de-registers a Rule Participant it must also
de-register all of the Facilities registered by the Rule Participant by
the time specified in the De-registration Notice. For the avoidance of
doubt, AEMO must not de-register a Rule Participant, if that Rule
Participant holds Capacity Credits for any of its Facilities.

2.32.8. The de-registration of a Rule Participant does not affect any
rights, obligations or liabilities arising under or in connection with
these WEM Rules prior to the time the Rule Participant ceases to be a
Rule Participant.

2.32.9. AEMO may require a Network Operator to disconnect one or more of
the Facilities registered by a suspended or deregistered Rule
Participant in order to give effect to a Suspension Notice or
deregistration. If AEMO gives a notice under this clause to a Network
Operator, then the Network Operator must comply with the notice as soon
as practicable. If the disconnection arises because of the suspension of
a Market Participant and the Suspension Notice is subsequently withdrawn
by AEMO under clause 2.32.5, then AEMO must request the relevant Network
Operator to reconnect the Facilities registered by the relevant Rule
Participant.

re-determine the RoCoF Ride-Through Capability accredited to a Facility,
which may include examples of changes to a Facility's performance that
would lead to an adjustment of the RoCoF Ride-Through Capability
accredited to the Facility;

vi\. the processes to be followed by AEMO, Market Participants and
Network Operators for any tests and re-tests of a Facility for the
accreditation, or re-accreditation, of RoCoF Ride-Through Capability for
a Facility; and

vii\. the timeframes, which must be reasonable, for notification
requirements and provision of information, including updating any
Standing Data or information in such other place as determined by AEMO
and specified in the WEM Procedure; and

\(c\) the processes to be followed by AEMO, including a consultation
process with Market Participants and Network Operators, in determining
or re-determining the RoCoF Ride-Through Cost Recovery Limit.

<p>Replacement section 3.6 outlines the obligations of AEMO and Network
Operators in relation to managing under frequency load shedding on the
SWIS. AEMO is required to prepare and publish an UFLS Requirements
document to set out the aggregate under frequency load shedding
requirements for the SWIS taking into account the SWIS Frequency
Operating Standards. Network Operators are required to design and
develop UFLS specifications to adhere to the requirements set out by
AEMO. Section 3.6 also sets out obligations for AEMO and Network
Operators to consult with each other when amendments to UFLS
Requirements are necessary and to monitor ongoing performance against
these documents.</p>
<p>In practice, when a frequency event occurs on the power system
resulting in frequency dropping below the levels identified in the
Frequency Operating Standard, the under frequency load shedding schemes
will operate in accordance with the parameters in the UFLS Requirements
and UFLS Specification documents. Other WEM rules (e.g. new section
3.2A) are already in place to ensure appropriate coordination between
AEMO as the System Operator and Network Operators.</p></th>

or

\(b\) considers, for any reason, that the System Restart Standard (or
any part of it) is no longer achievable or effective,

AEMO must review the System Restart Standard or the System Restart Plan,
or both, if required, and make any revisions that AEMO considers are
necessary to ensure that the System Restart Standard and the System
Restart Plan are achievable and effective for restarting the SWIS in the
event of a system shutdown or major supply disruption.

3.7.11. Without limiting the frequency of reviews AEMO may undertake in
accordance with clause 3.7.10, AEMO must review the System Restart
Standard and the System Restart Plan to ensure they are appropriate and

3.8A. Contingency Events

3.8A.1. A Contingency Event is an event affecting the SWIS which AEMO
expects would be likely to involve:

\(a\) the failure or removal from operational service of one or more
energy producing units, Facilities and/or Network elements; or

\(b\) an unplanned change in load, Intermittent Generation or other
elements of the SWIS not controlled by AEMO.

3.8A.2. A Credible Contingency Event means one or more Contingency
Events, the occurrence of which AEMO considers in accordance with the
WEM Procedure referred to in clause 3.8A.4 to be reasonably possible in
the prevailing circumstances, taking into account the Technical
Envelope. Without limitation, examples of Credible Contingency Events
include:

\(a\) the unexpected automatic or manual disconnection of, or the
unplanned change in output of, one or more operating energy producing
units or Facilities;

\(b\) the unexpected disconnection of one or more major items of Network
equipment; or

\(c\) Non-credible Contingency Events reclassified as Credible
Contingency Events in accordance with the WEM Procedure referred to in
clause 3.8A.4.

3.8A.3. A Non-credible Contingency Event means a Contingency Event other
than a Credible Contingency Event. Without limitation, examples of
Non-credible Contingency Events include simultaneous disruptive events
such as:

\(a\) multiple Facility failures; or

\(b\) failure of multiple items of Network equipment.

3.8A.4. AEMO must develop and maintain a WEM Procedure which sets out:

\(a\) the process for determination and classification of Credible
Contingency Events;

\(b\) the Contingency Reclassification Conditions;

\(c\) the factors that AEMO may take into account in reclassifying a
Contingency Event in accordance with this section 3.8A;

\(d\) the process for reclassifying a Non-credible Contingency Event as
a Credible Contingency Event;

\(e\) the procedures for notifying affected Rule Participants under
clause 3.8A.7, including the time by which a notification must be given;
and

\(f\) a description of the Contingency Events that are generally
considered as Credible Contingency Events, taking into consideration
relevant requirements in the Technical Rules of the relevant Network
Operator.

3.8A.5. AEMO must:

\(a\) determine a Credible Contingency Event; and

\(b\) reclassify a Non-credible Contingency Event as a Credible
Contingency Event,

in accordance with the WEM Procedure referred to in clause 3.8A.4.

3.8A.6. Where AEMO determines a new Credible Contingency Event, or
reclassifies a Non-credible Contingency Event as a Credible Contingency
Event, AEMO must:

\(a\) publish the determination or reclassification on the WEM Website;
and

\(b\) notify affected Rule Participants in accordance with the WEM
Procedure referred to in clause 3.8A.4 of all relevant information,
including but not limited to:

i\. the name of the new Credible Contingency Event;

ii\. a description of the new Credible Contingency Event;

iii\. any relevant timeframes in respect of the new Credible Contingency
Event; and

iv\. if applicable, the Contingency Reclassification Conditions that
gave rise to the reclassification of a Non-credible Contingency Event as
a Credible Contingency Event.

3.8A.7. If any of the information provided to Rule Participants in
accordance with clause 3.8A.6 changes in any material respect, AEMO must
publish the changes on the WEM Website and notify the affected Rule
Participants in accordance with the WEM Procedure referred to in clause
3.8A.4.

Essential System Services

3.9. Definitions of Essential System Services

3.9.1. Regulation is the service, measured in MW, of frequently
adjusting the Injection or Withdrawal of a Facility in accordance with
an AEMO centralised control scheme in order to assist in maintaining the
SWIS Frequency according to the Frequency Operating Standards.

3.9.2. Regulation Raise is a Regulation service, measured in MW of
response capability, that operates to raise the SWIS Frequency.

3.9.3. Regulation Lower is a Regulation service, measured in MW of
response capability, that operates to lower the SWIS Frequency.

3.9.4. Contingency Reserve is the service, measured in MW, of holding
response capability associated with a Facility in reserve so that the
relevant Facility can rapidly adjust Injection or Withdrawal in order to
assist in maintaining the SWIS Frequency according to the Frequency
Operating Standards after a Contingency Event.

3.9.5. Contingency Reserve Raise is a Contingency Reserve service,
measured in MW of response capability, that enables a Facility to adjust
Injection or Withdrawal to raise the SWIS Frequency.

3.9.6. Contingency Reserve Lower is a Contingency Reserve service,
measured in MW of response capability, that enables a Facility to adjust
Injection or Withdrawal to lower the SWIS Frequency.

3.9.7. Rate of Change of Frequency Control Service (“**RoCoF Control
Service**”) is the service, measured in MWs, of providing Inertia which
provides instantaneous response to slow down the rate of change of the
SWIS Frequency.

3.9.8. System Restart Service is the service of an Energy Producing
System starting without requiring energy to be supplied from a Network
to assist in the re-energisation of the SWIS in the event of system
shutdown, or a major supply disruption.

for Non-Co-optimised Essential System Service is to enable AEMO and
Western Power to identify and justify the need for an ESS not already
available through existing market mechanisms, and to procure those
services in a transparent and efficient manner.</p>
<p>The NCESS framework outlines:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>the roles of the Coordinator, AEMO and Western Power under the
NCESS framework;</p></li>
<li><p>the conditions associated with power system security and
reliability and market costs that would require Western Power and/or

3.11A.2. If AEMO or a Network Operator reasonably considers that one or
more of the following events has occurred or applies:

\(a\) if the forecasted or actual magnitude and frequency of Energy
Uplift Payments in the WEM increases to an uneconomic level (assuming
locational and situational market power is being controlled under the
relevant processes), this indicates a locational constraint in the
network and a case may be made to procure locational services to relieve
the network constraint;

\(b\) frequent AEMO Intervention Events to relieve non-frequency control
constraints such as loss of reactive power or system strength indicates
a network security problem, and a case could be made to procure a
locational security NCESS;

\(c\) if network planning assumptions change at any time during the
network planning timeframe (for example, demand is lower or higher than
forecast), it may signal the need for an emerging service such as
reactive power support or voltage stability which could be provided by
non-network services located in the relevant part of the network;

\(d\) a modification to an existing Power System Security or Power
System Reliability standard or the introduction of a new Power System
Security or Power System Reliability standard within a network planning
cycle may trigger the need to procure a NCESS; or

\(e\) AEMO considers, in the course of its normal power system
operations, that a significant threat to Power System Security or Power
System Reliability exists or is emerging, and the existing mechanisms
under these WEM Rules may not be sufficient to address the threat,

then:

\(f\) AEMO must notify the relevant Network Operator, or the Network
Operator must notify AEMO (as applicable), of each event that AEMO or
the Network Operator (as applicable) considers has occurred or applies,
as soon as practicable but in any event before making a submission under

<p>New section 3.15A sets out the regime for the new SESSM for procuring
FCESS. This new regime replaces the current contract-based
mechanism.</p>
<p>Set out below is an extract from the Taskforce’s Information Paper
<em>Supplementary ESS Procurement Mechanism</em> to provide some
background to the new regime. You should refer to the Information Paper
for further details.</p>
<p>FCESS will be primarily procured via real-time markets, with
participation from all capable and accredited facilities enabled, but
not mandatory. Nevertheless, to protect against the risk of market
failure in what will be relatively small and concentrated markets, the
Taskforce has endorsed the SESSM to provide a means for longer-term
contractual arrangements to increase certainty, mitigate inefficient
market outcomes, support new market entry, and avoid a shortfall in ESS
accreditation and participation. Contrasting with current arrangements,
the SESSM will be implemented through a transparent tender process in
the WEM Rules, rather than through individually negotiated bilateral
contracts.</p>
<p>The broad objectives of the SESSM are to:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>incentivise new FCESS providers to enter the market;</p></li>
<li><p>mitigate scarcity in FCESS markets, manifesting either as a
shortfall of accredited facilities, or shortfall of participation;
and</p></li>
<li><p>mitigation of market power by:</p></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><blockquote>
<p>the threat of competitive entry; and</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote>
<p>a mechanism of ex-ante review of the operating costs of ESS providers
by the Economic Regulation Authority.</p>
</blockquote></li>

<p>The procurement of SESSM broadly consists of seven stages:
Triggering, SESSM Service Specification, Veto of Procurement,
Procurement Process, Selection, Veto of Award, and SESSM.</p></th>

i\. comply with the requirements of clause 3.15A.24 and clause 3.15A.25;
and

ii\. meet the SESSM Service Specification which, taken together, in
AEMO’s opinion will result in the lowest cost of providing the Frequency
Co-optimised Essential System Service in accordance with clause
3.15A.27;

\(b\) identify the Market Participants and the Facilities who it
approves and intends to grant a SESSM Award; and

\(c\) notify the Economic Regulation Authority in accordance with clause
3.15A.29.

3.15A.27. When selecting the lowest cost combination of SESSM
Submissions in accordance with clause 3.15A.26(a), AEMO must:

\(a\) exclude SESSM Submissions that do not comply with the SESSM
Service Specification;

\(b\) exclude SESSM Submissions for new facilities where insufficient
evidence has been provided to support the Key Project Dates or that all
necessary Environmental Approvals have been granted;

\(c\) identify historical Dispatch Intervals matching the SESSM Service
Specification;

\(d\) calculate energy price profiles for energy matching the SESSM
Service Timing for those Dispatch Intervals on the basis of three
categories being average cost, high cost and low cost;

\(e\) calculate effective Frequency Co-optimised Essential System
Service offer prices for each SESSM Submission comprising:

i\. proposed SESSM Availability Payment divided by the sum of all SESSM
Availability Quantities within the SESSM Award Duration;

ii\. proposed SESSM Offer Cap; and

iii\. expected FCESS Uplift Payments based on:

1\. Standing Enablement Minimum;

2\. start-up costs; and

3\. minimum running costs; and

\(f\) calculate the lowest cost combination of SESSM Submissions to
deliver the requirement under each of the three energy price profiles
referred to in clause 3.15A.27(d);

\(g\) for submissions provided in accordance with 3.15A.21 adjust the
SESSM Availability Quantity to account for Network Constraints; and

\(h\) adjust the SESSM Availability Quantity to account for AEMO’s
assessed capability of the Facility to provide the relevant Frequency
Co-optimised Essential System Service.

3.15A.28. If AEMO is selecting Facilities to meet more than one SESSM
Service Specification in a single SESSM procurement process, AEMO must:

\(a\) identify where the SESSM Submissions from a Facility for the
provision of different Frequency Co-optimised Essential System Services
would be provided from the same portion of the Facility’s capacity;

\(b\) determine the order of selection for the affected Frequency
Co-optimised Essential System Services;

\(c\) in selecting Facilities to provide each of the Frequency
Co-optimised Essential System Services, exclude any SESSM Submissions
for the Facility’s capacity that has already been selected for a SESSM
Award under a previous selection; and

\(d\) ensure that proposed SESSM Awards will deliver the total Essential
System Service requirement.

3.15A.29. AEMO must notify the Economic Regulation Authority of the
outcome of the SESSM, including providing the Economic Regulation
Authority with the following information:

\(a\) the names of the parties and the facility details (including, if
already registered, the identity of the Market Participants and the
Facilities), it intends to grant a SESSM Award to;

\(b\) based on the results from the operation of clause 3.15A.27, the
estimated aggregated cost of all SESSM Awards it intends to grant;

\(c\) the proposed SESSM Service Commencement Date;

\(d\) AEMO's reasonable estimate of the cost of procuring the Frequency
Co-optimised Essential System Services based on the historic costs of
the Frequency Co-optimised Essential System Services (as if the SESSM
Awards it intends to grant were not made); and

\(e\) a comparison of the calculated effective Frequency Co-optimised
Essential System Service offer prices to the prices for the Frequency
Co-optimised Essential System Service in the Real-Time Market within the
SESSM Service Timing for the relevant Frequency Co-optimised Essential
System Service over the previous 12 months.

<p>Section 3.15B sets out the regime for a new periodic expressions of
interest process to provide a benchmark for market pricing of ESS. It
sets out a market sounding process in order for AEMO to test the market.
It will not result in the award of SESSM Award but it will assist the
ERA to determine whether the current market price is appropriate and
whether there is a need to trigger the SESSM. Additionally, the process
provides engagement with new facilities to understand the accreditation
process and allows participants to prepare submissions in readiness for
a short lead-time SESSM procurement.</p>
<p>The expressions of interest process is to be run by AEMO but it is
noted that AEMO doesn’t use the information collected through the

be run in early 2022, and transitional rules will be developed to

3.18C. Outage Coordination

3.18C.1. For the purposes of this section 3.18C:

\(a\) a Network Operator that submits an Outage Plan that impacts an
Outage Facility (other than a Load) of a Market Participant is an
“Impacting Participant”; and

\(b\) a Market Participant whose Outage Facility (other than a Load) is
impacted by a Network Operator is an “Impacted Participant”,

where "impacts" and "impacted" are determined as per the process
identified in the WEM Procedure in clause 3.18.4.

3.18C.2. An Outage Plan that is submitted by an Impacting Participant,
who is aware of an impact, must include:

\(a\) a confirmation by the Impacting Participant that it has notified
the Impacted Participant; and

\(b\) details of the discussions between the Impacting Participant and
Impacted Participants to coordinate the Outage proposed in the Outage
Plan and the outcome of those discussions,

at least 6 months prior to the Outage Commencement Interval.

3.18C.3. An Impacted Participant may request AEMO to undertake Outage
coordination where:

\(a\) it reasonably considers that its Outage Facility will be unduly
impacted by an Outage Plan having regard to matters specified in the WEM
Procedure referred to in clause 3.18.4;

\(b\) it has requested the Impacting Participant to vary the Outage
Period or any other component of the Outage Plan in order to minimise
the impact on its Outage Facility; and

\(c\) its request is made in accordance with the process specified in
the WEM Procedure referred to in clause 3.18.4.

3.18C.4. Following a request from an Impacted Participant under clause
3.18C.3, AEMO must determine, acting reasonably, and in accordance with
the principles specified in clause 3.18C.5 and the WEM Procedure
referred to in clause 3.18.4, whether the Outage Plan submitted by the
Impacting Participant should be revised and the revisions that are
required to be made.

3.18C.5. When making a determination under clause 3.18C.4, AEMO must
have regard to the following principles in the following order of
importance:

\(a\) any Power System Security or Power System Reliability implications
if the Outage Plan submitted by the Impacting Participant did not occur
at the Outage Commencement Interval and for the Outage Period requested;

\(b\) whether the Outage Plan submitted by the Impacting Participant was
foreshadowed in the Outage Intention Plan;

\(c\) the notice provided by the Impacting Participant for the Outage
Plan and the timing of the request for Outage coordination by the
Impacted Participant;

\(d\) the technical reasons for the Outage Facility Maintenance, and the
implications for the Outage Facility if the Outage Facility Maintenance
is not commenced at the Outage Commencement Interval requested;

\(e\) any reasons, other than financial implications, provided by the
Impacting Participant in the Outage Plan as to why the Outage Plan could
not be varied as requested by the Impacted Participant;

\(f\) any other principles referred to in clause 3.18C.12(d); and

\(g\) any other information provided by the Impacting Participant or an
Impacted Participant to AEMO as part of the Outage coordination.

3.18C.6. AEMO must notify each Impacted Participant and the Impacting
Participant of its determination under clause 3.18C.4 as soon as
practicable.

3.18C.7. AEMO may include in the Outage coordination any other Impacted
Participant when undertaking Outage coordination whether or not that
Impacted Participant has requested Outage coordination by AEMO.

3.18C.8. In making a determination in respect of the coordination of an
Outage, AEMO must consult, in accordance with any process specified in
the WEM Procedure referred to in clause 3.18.4, with each Impacted
Participant.

3.18C.9. A Market Participant and Network Operator must comply with a
determination by AEMO under clause 3.18C.4, and, if required, revise or
withdraw the Outage Plan.

3.18C.10. Where AEMO notifies a Market Participant or Network Operator
that an Outage Plan submitted by it is unacceptable, and the Economic
Regulation Authority does not give AEMO a direction under clause
3.18F.6(e), then AEMO and the Market Participant or Network Operator
must use best endeavours to agree an alternative time for the relevant
Outage Plan.

3.18E.1. For each Outage Plan that AEMO is required to undertake an
Outage Evaluation, AEMO must:

\(a\) where possible to do so, and subject to all required information
being available, undertake the Outage Evaluation as soon as practicable
after the Outage Plan has been submitted or revised;

\(b\) notify the relevant Market Participant or Network Operator as soon
as practicable of the outcome of the Outage Evaluation;

\(c\) publish the status of the Outage Plan following completion of the
Outage Evaluation, including an assessment of whether a Planned Outage
is at risk of rejection; and

\(d\) keep a record of the Outage Evaluation, together with the reasons
for each Outage Evaluation and assessment.

3.18E.2. For an Outage Plan that is not yet approved, if:

\(a\) the relevant Outage Capability is subject to a Planned Outage and
AEMO has received a notification under clause 3.18D.9 in relation to
that Planned Outage;

\(b\) the relevant Outage Capability is subject to a Planned Outage and
AEMO is aware that it should have received a notification under clause
3.18D.9 in relation to that Planned Outage; or

\(c\) the relevant Outage Capability is subject to a Forced Outage,

then, AEMO must delay the Outage Evaluation for that Outage Plan until:

\(d\) the relevant Outage Capability is returned to service; or

\(e\) AEMO receives evidence to its satisfaction from the Market
Participant or Network Operator that the relevant Outage Capability
would not be subject to an Outage before the Outage Commencement
Interval in the Outage Plan that is awaiting approval.

3.18E.3. AEMO must reject an Outage Plan for an Equipment List Facility
or Self-Scheduling Outage Facility if it is aware that any of the
requirements for an Outage Plan in clause 3.18B.8 have not been met or
complied with.

3.18E.4. If an Outage Plan for a Self-Scheduling Outage Facility is not
rejected by AEMO under clause 3.18E.3, AEMO is deemed to have approved
the Outage Plan from the time AEMO received the request for approval of
the Outage Plan under clause 3.18B.2.

3.18E.5. AEMO must evaluate all Outage Plans for Equipment List
Facilities as required by these WEM Rules by assessing the Outage Plan
against the Outage Evaluation Criteria (“**Outage Evaluation**”). This
evaluation must:

\(a\) be undertaken on Outage Plans in the order in which they are
submitted to AEMO unless AEMO considers it is more efficient or
effective to evaluate Outage Plans out of order;

\(b\) be based on the information available to AEMO at the time the
Outage Evaluation is undertaken;

\(c\) occur when an Outage Plan is received or revised and where
required as part of the PASA studies; and

\(d\) where an Availability Declaration Exemption applies in respect of
Mandatory Routine Maintenance, not result in the Outage Plan being
rejected due to that Mandatory Routine Maintenance not being completed
before the applicable deadline.

3.18E.6. In respect of an Outage Evaluation for an Outage Plan of an
Equipment List Facility for Opportunistic Maintenance, AEMO:

\(a\) may reject the Outage Plan if it considers there is inadequate
time to undertake the Outage Evaluation;

\(b\) is deemed to have rejected the Outage Plan 120 minutes before the
Outage Commencement Interval if the Outage Evaluation has not been
completed and the relevant Market Participant or Network Operator has
not been notified of the Outage Evaluation outcome; and otherwise

\(c\) must approve the Outage Plan if it considers the Outage Evaluation
Criteria has been met.

3.18E.7. In respect of an Outage Evaluation for an Outage Plan of an
Equipment List Facility that is not for Opportunistic Maintenance, AEMO:

\(a\) must approve or reject each Outage Plan using the Outage
Evaluation Criteria and in accordance with the WEM Procedure referred to
in clause 3.18.4;

\(b\) must not show bias towards a Market Participant or Network
Operator in evaluating the Outage Plan other than as required by the
process for prioritisation set out in the WEM Procedure referred to in
clause 3.18.4;

\(c\) may reject an Outage Plan where the Outage Plan First Submission
Date was less than six weeks before the Outage Commencement Interval
without evaluation if, in its opinion, the submitting party has not
allowed adequate time for the Outage Plan to be assessed;

\(d\) may approve an Outage Plan where the Outage Evaluation Criteria
are met for the Outage Period;

\(e\) may approve an Outage Plan, despite the Outage Evaluation Criteria
not being met, if AEMO reasonably considers that rejecting the Outage
Plan would pose a greater threat to Power System Security or Power
System Reliability over the long term;

\(f\) is deemed to have rejected the Outage Plan at 2:00 PM on the
Trading Day two days prior to the Outage Commencement Interval, if the
Outage Evaluation has not been completed and the relevant Market
Participant or Network Operator has not been notified of the Outage
Evaluation outcome; and

\(g\) may consider more than one Outage Plan together and approve or
reject the Outage Plans as a group.

3.18E.8. The Outage Evaluation Criteria ("**Outage Evaluation
Criteria**") is met when in AEMO’s opinion there will be sufficient
Network in service and capacity available for dispatch to maintain Power
System Security and Power System Reliability in accordance with the
Power System Security Principles and Power System Reliability
Principles, taking into account the methods and criteria specified in
the WEM Procedure referred to in clause 3.18.4.

3.18E.9. AEMO may undertake a single Outage Evaluation for a group of
related Outage Plans. When a group of Outage Plans that are considered
together do not meet the Outage Evaluation Criteria, then AEMO must
follow the process for prioritisation in the WEM Procedure referred to
in clause 3.18.4.

3.21.1. A Forced Outage is any Outage, or part of any Outage, of an
Outage Facility that has not been approved by AEMO, including:

\(a\) Outages as a result of:

i\. a direction from AEMO under clause 2.28.3B; or

ii\. a non-compliance with a Registered Generator Performance Standard;

\(b\) any Dispatch Intervals of an Outage that commence prior to its
approved Outage Commencement Interval, or extend beyond its approved
Outage Completion Interval; and

\(c\) where the Market Participant or Network Operator does not follow
an Outage Recall Direction from AEMO to return the equipment to service
within the time specified in the Outage Contingency Plan,

but does not include Outages of a Facility that occur within a period in
which the Facility is subject to an approved Commissioning Test Plan and
are caused by a failure of the Facility’s equipment during that
Commissioning Test Period.

Market Participant must submit to the relevant Network Operator,
Proposed Generator Performance Standards for the generating works as if
the generating works were a Transmission Connected Generating System
addressing each Technical Requirement.

3A.5.2. Each Proposed Generator Performance Standard submitted under
clause 3A.5.1 or clause 3A.14.1(a) must meet the Common Requirements
and:

\(a\) be equal to or better than the Ideal Generator Performance
Standard; or

\(b\) if a Proposed Negotiated Generator Performance Standard is
submitted:

i\. be no less onerous than the Minimum Performance Standard;

ii\. demonstrate any applicable Negotiation Criteria have been met;

approve a Proposed Generator Performance Standard that is equal to or
better than the Ideal Generator Performance Standard for a Technical
Requirement.

3A.5.5. A Proposed Negotiated Generator Performance Standard must be as
consistent as practicable with the corresponding Ideal Generator
Performance Standard for that Technical Requirement, having regard to:

\(a\) the need to protect the Transmission Connected Generating System
from damage;

\(b\) power system conditions at the location of the connection or
proposed connection; and

\(c\) the commercial and technical feasibility of complying with the
Ideal Generator Performance Standard.

3A.5.6. A Proposed Negotiated Generator Performance Standard may include
a Trigger Event which must address:

\(a\) the conditions for determining whether the Trigger Event has
occurred;

\(b\) the party responsible for determining whether the Trigger Event
has occurred;

\(c\) the actions required to be taken and any revised standard or
technical level of performance in respect of a Technical Requirement
which must be achieved if the Trigger Event occurs;

\(d\) the maximum timeframe for compliance with any action required to
be taken and each revised standard or technical level of performance in
respect of a Technical Requirement following the Trigger Event;

\(e\) any requirements to provide information and supporting evidence
required by the Network Operator or AEMO to demonstrate that, if the
Trigger Event occurs, the actions required will occur and will deliver
the agreed outcome and level of performance required by any revised
standard or technical level of performance in respect of a Technical
Requirement;

3A.5.7. If a Registered Generator Performance Standard includes a
Trigger Event and the Trigger Event subsequently occurs, the Market
Participant responsible for the Transmission Connected Generating System
must comply with the requirements of the Trigger Event.

3A.5.8. A Trigger Event contained in a Registered Generator Performance
Standard may be modified by written agreement between the Market
Participant responsible for the Transmission Connected Generating
System, AEMO and the relevant Network Operator. For the avoidance of
doubt, the process that applies to a Proposed Negotiated Generator
Performance Standard in this section 3A.5 does not apply to the
modification of a Trigger Event contained in a Registered Generator
Performance Standard under this clause 3A.5.8.

3A.5.9. If a Market Participant responsible for a Transmission Connected
Generating System submits to the Network Operator a Proposed Negotiated
Generator Performance Standard under clause 3A.5.1 or clause 3A.14.1(a),
the Market Participant responsible for the Transmission Connected
Generating System must provide to the relevant Network Operator:

listed in clause 3A.5.5.

3A.5.10. If, following the receipt of a Proposed Negotiated Generator
Performance Standard and the information and evidence referred to in
clause 3A.5.9, the Network Operator reasonably considers it will approve
the Proposed Negotiated Generator Performance Standard, the Network
Operator, in accordance with the process agreed under clause 3A.1.3,
must:

\(a\) provide the information received from the Market Participant
responsible for the Transmission Connected Generating System under
clause 3A.5.9 to AEMO; and

Negotiated Generator Performance Standard should be approved or rejected
by the Network Operator, or whether AEMO requires further information to
make the recommendation in accordance with the process agreed under
clause 3A.1.3.

3A.5.12. Where AEMO requires further information that it considers
necessary to make the recommendation in clause 3A.5.11, the Network
Operator, in accordance with the process agreed under clause 3A.1.3,
must:

\(a\) provide the further information that is in its possession, power
or control; or

\(b\) use reasonable endeavours to obtain that information from the
Market Participant responsible for the Transmission Connected Generating
System and provide that information to AEMO.

3A.5.13. In making a recommendation whether a Proposed Negotiated

information provided by the Network Operator and may use any other
relevant information available to it.

3A.5.14. AEMO must recommend that the Network Operator reject a Proposed
Negotiated Generator Performance Standard in accordance with clause
3A.5.11 if it reasonably considers that the Proposed Negotiated
Generator Performance Standard may adversely affect Power System
Security or Power System Reliability.

3A.5.15. Where AEMO recommends that the Network Operator reject a
Proposed Negotiated Generator Performance Standard in accordance with
clause 3A.5.11, AEMO must:

\(a\) provide written reasons to the Network Operator; and

\(b\) in respect of the relevant Technical Requirement, recommend that
either:

i\. if applicable, an alternative Proposed Negotiated Generator
Performance Standard that AEMO considers meets the requirements of
clause 3A.5.2(b), which may include a Trigger Event, is adopted; or

ii\. otherwise, the Ideal Generator Performance Standard is adopted.

3A.5.16. Subject to clause 3A.5.17, after a Network Operator has
received the recommendation from AEMO under clause 3A.5.11, the Network
Operator must determine whether to approve or reject each Proposed
Negotiated Generator Performance Standard proposed by the Market
Participant responsible for the Transmission Connected Generating
System.

3A.5.17. A Network Operator must reject a Proposed Negotiated Generator
Performance Standard in accordance with clause 3A.5.16 where:

\(a\) in the Network Operator’s reasonable opinion:

i\. one or more of the requirements in clause 3A.5.2(b); or

ii\. in the case of a Relevant Generator Modification, one or more of
the requirements in clause 3A.14.1,

are not met;

\(b\) AEMO has recommended in accordance with clause 3A.5.11 that the
Network Operator reject the Proposed Negotiated Generator Performance
Standard; or

\(c\) in the Network Operator’s reasonable opinion, the Proposed
Negotiated Generator Performance Standard will adversely affect:

i\. Power System Security;

ii\. Power System Reliability;

iii\. Power Transfer Capability; or

iv\. the quality of supply of electricity for other users of the
Network.

3A.5.18. If a Network Operator rejects a Proposed Negotiated Generator

Operator must provide to the Market Participant responsible for the
Transmission Connected Generating System:

\(a\) written reasons for the rejection; and

\(b\) if applicable, an alternative Proposed Negotiated Generator
Performance Standard that the Network Operator and AEMO consider meets
the requirements of clause 3A.5.2(b), which may include a Trigger Event.

3A.5.19. The Market Participant responsible for the Transmission
Connected Generating System may, in relation to an alternative Proposed
Negotiated Generator Performance Standard provided by the Network
Operator in accordance with clause 3A.5.18(b), either:

\(a\) accept the alternative Proposed Negotiated Generator Performance
Standard; or

\(b\) reject the alternative Proposed Negotiated Generator Performance
Standard; and

i\. propose a different alternative Proposed Negotiated Generator
Performance Standard consistent with the requirements of clause
3A.5.2(b), which may include a Trigger Event, in which case the process
for consideration and approval of Proposed Generator Performance
Standards in this section 3A.5 applies; or

ii\. elect to adopt the Ideal Generator Performance Standard for the
relevant Technical Requirement.

3A.5.20. When a Proposed Generator Performance Standard is approved in
accordance with clause 3A.5.4, clause 3A.5.16, or accepted by the Market
Participant under clause 3A.5.19(a), it must be recorded by the relevant
Network Operator on the Generator Register and it will be a Registered

operating range set out in Table 1, Appendix 13 for the SWIS and Table
2, Appendix 13 for an Island.

3B.2.2. The Normal Operating Frequency Excursion Band is an allowable
frequency operating range where no action or response is required by
AEMO for infrequent or momentary excursions outside of the Normal
Operating Frequency Band. The frequency operating range and duration are
set out in Table 1, Appendix 13 for the SWIS.

3B.2.3. The Credible Contingency Event Frequency Band is the allowable
frequency operating range where there has been a Credible Contingency
Event on the SWIS. The frequency operating range and duration are set
out in Table 1, Appendix 13 for the SWIS and Table 2, Appendix 13 for an
Island.

3B.2.4. The Island Separation Frequency Band is the allowable frequency
operating range immediately following a Separation Event on the SWIS
which creates one or more Islands. The frequency operating range and

10 seconds for 99% of the time over any rolling 30-day period in the
SWIS.

3B.3.2. Subject to clause 3B.3.3, the SWIS Frequency must not exceed the
Normal Operating Frequency Band in accordance with the relevant
requirements set out in Table 1, Appendix 13 for the SWIS and Table 2,
Appendix 13 for an Island.

3B.3.3. The SWIS Frequency may exceed the relevant Normal Operating
Frequency Band following the occurrence of a Contingency Event.

3B.3.4. Subject to clause 3B.3.8, the SWIS Frequency must not exceed the
Normal Operating Frequency Excursion Band, and must Stabilise, in
accordance with the relevant requirements set out in Table 1, Appendix
13 for the SWIS and Table 2, Appendix 13 for an Island.

3B.3.5. Subject to clause 3B.3.6, for any Credible Contingency Event,
the SWIS Frequency must not exceed the relevant rate of change
requirements set out in Table 1, Appendix 13 for the SWIS and Table 2,
Appendix 13 for an Island.

occurs.

3B.3.9. Following a Separation Event, an Island is permitted to be
temporarily de-energised with frequency subsequently required to be
restored to the relevant requirements set out in Table 2, Appendix 13
for an Island as soon as practicable.

3B.3.10. Subject to clause 3B.3.9, if there is a Separation Event, SWIS
Frequency must not exceed the Island Separation Frequency Band, and must
Stabilise and Recover, in accordance with the relevant requirements set
out in Table 1, Appendix 13 for the SWIS and Table 2, Appendix 13 for an
Island.

3B.3.11. For a Non-Credible Contingency Event or Multiple Contingency
Event, reasonable endeavours must be taken to maintain the SWIS
Frequency in accordance with the Extreme Frequency Tolerance Band, and
to Stabilise and Recover the SWIS Frequency in accordance with the
relevant requirements set out in Table 1, Appendix 13 for the SWIS and
Table 2, Appendix 13 for an Island. For the avoidance of doubt, the use
of load shedding is acceptable in order to meet the requirements of this
clause 3B.3.11.

3B.3.12. Based on the readings recorded in AEMO’s SCADA system, a
Contingency Event, including a Credible Contingency Event, Separation
Event, commences at the time SWIS Frequency exceeds the frequencies in
the Normal Operating Frequency Excursion Band set out in Table 1,
Appendix 13 for the SWIS and Table 2, Appendix 13 for an Island, and
ends at the time at which SWIS Frequency Recovers.

3B.3.13. For the avoidance of doubt, reasonable endeavours in this
section 3B.3 includes allowance for avoiding pre-contingent load
shedding, or to prioritise restoration of load, over meeting the
Frequency Operating Standards in an Island.

shortfalls in each Relevant Year in the Long Term PASA Study Horizon,
for each of the following scenarios:

i\. median peak demand assuming low demand growth;

ii\. one in ten year peak demand assuming low demand growth;

iii\. median peak demand assuming expected demand growth;

iv\. one in ten year peak demand assuming expected demand growth;

v\. median peak demand assuming high demand growth;

vi\. one in ten year peak demand assuming high demand growth,

where the low, expected, and high demand growth cases reflect demand
changes stemming from different levels of economic growth, with these
being temperature adjusted to produce the one in ten year peak demand
cases.

\(b\) forecast the Reserve Capacity Target and corresponding expected
peak demand for each Capacity Year during the Long Term PASA Study
Horizon, where:

i\. the Reserve Capacity Target for a Capacity Year is the capacity
required to meet the Planning Criterion in that year under the scenario
described in clause 4.5.10(a)(iv); and

ii\. the expected peak demand in that year is the peak demand under the

\(d\) identify any potential transmission, generation, storage or demand
side capacity augmentation options to alleviate capacity shortfalls

\(e\) develop a two dimensional duration curve of the forecast minimum
capacity requirements over the Capacity Year (“Availability Curve”) for
each of the second and third Capacity Years of the Long Term PASA Study

\(a\) \[Blank\]

\(b\) the minimum capacity required to be provided by Availability
Class 1 capacity if Power System Security and Power System Reliability

ii the Planning Criterion and the criteria for evaluating Outage Plans
set out in clause 3.18E.8 were to be applied to the load scenario

it would be possible to satisfy the Planning Criterion and the Outage

procedural step missing in this verification process in that it would be
prudent to allow AEMO to request further information should it require
such information, before having to reject an application. This will
ensure additional administrative burden does not result where an
applicant would need to re-lodge an application if information is
missing. The ETIU and AEMO will examine this issue to determine whether
additional process is required in the WEM Rules.</p></th>

4.11.4. Subject to clause 4.11.12, when assigning Certified Reserve
Capacity, AEMO must assign an Availability Class to apply to that
Certified Reserve Capacity as follows:

\(a\) Availability Class 1 where either:

i\. the Facility contains an Intermittent Generating System or
Non‑Intermittent Generating System; or

ii\. AEMO reasonably expects the Facility to be available to be
dispatched for all Trading Intervals in a Capacity Year, allowing for
Outages and any restrictions on the availability specified by the
applicant under clause 4.10.1(g); or

\(b\) Availability Class 2 otherwise.

4.11.5. In assigning Certified Reserve Capacity to a Facility, AEMO may:

\(a\) require Network Operators to confirm that the data and information
related to clause 4.10.1(bA) provided to AEMO by or on behalf of an
applicant for Certified Reserve Capacity is complete, accurate and up to
date; and

\(b\) request that a Network Operator provide AEMO within a reasonable
timeframe with any other information held by the Network Operator that
the Network Operator reasonably considers is relevant to the
application,

and Network Operators must use their best endeavours to cooperate with
such requests and provide the information requested within the timeframe
specified by AEMO in the request.

4.11.6. AEMO must accredit not less than two independent experts at any
time to prepare reports on the estimated Reserve Capacity of an
Intermittent Generating System or a Non-Scheduled Facility (excluding
where clause 4.11.1(bD)(ii) applies) that are yet to commence operation,
at the expense of the applicant. AEMO:

\(a\) must publish the contact details of these accredited independent
experts on the WEM Website;

\(b\) must ensure that any expert it accredits is familiar with the
meaning of the value to be estimated; and

\(c\) can remove accreditation of an expert at any time, but must allow
the expert to complete any work in progress as an accredited expert at
the time accreditation is removed.

4.11.8. \[Blank\]

4.11.9. \[Blank\]

4.11.10. Upon the receipt of advice provided in accordance with clause
4.10.4 for a Facility that has already been assigned Capacity Credits
for the relevant Capacity Year, AEMO must review the information
provided and decide whether it is necessary for AEMO to reassess the
assignment of Certified Reserve Capacity to the Facility.

4.11.10A. Where AEMO decides under clause 4.11.10 that it is necessary
for AEMO to reassess the assignment of Certified Reserve Capacity to a
Facility because the level assigned may have been too high, AEMO must:

\(a\) if information provided to AEMO under clause 4.10.4 would have
resulted in AEMO assigning a lower, non-zero level of Certified Reserve
Capacity to the Facility:

i\. reduce the Capacity Credits assigned to that Facility accordingly;
and

ii\. advise the Market Participant within 90 days of receiving the
submission under clause 4.10.4; or

\(b\) otherwise, do nothing.

4.11.11. Where AEMO reassesses the amount of Certified Reserve Capacity
assigned to a Facility under clauses 4.11.10 and 4.11.10A based on
information provided to AEMO under clause 4.10.4 the Market Participant
will pay a Reassessment Fee to cover the cost of processing the
reassessment.

4.12. Setting Reserve Capacity Obligations

4.12.1. The Reserve Capacity Obligations for each Market Participant
holding Capacity Credits are as follows:

\(a\) a Market Participant must ensure that for each Trading Interval,
the MW quantity of capacity provided through the Bilateral Submission
and STEM Submission processes, as determined for the Market Participant
under clause 4.26.2AE, is greater than or equal to the MW quantity
determined for the Market Participant under clause 4.26.2AB; and

\(b\) a Market Participant must make the capacity associated with the
Capacity Credits which are assigned to its Registered Facility for each
Dispatch Interval available for dispatch by AEMO in accordance with
Chapter 7, up to the Reserve Capacity Obligation Quantity for the
Registered Facility for the relevant Dispatch Interval.

4.13. Reserve Capacity Security[3]

4.13.1. Where AEMO assigns Certified Reserve Capacity to a Facility
(which, for the purposes of this section 4.13, excludes a Demand Side
Programme) that is yet to enter service (or re-enter service after
significant maintenance or having been upgraded), the relevant Market
Participant must ensure that AEMO holds the benefit of a Reserve
Capacity Security that is:

\(a\) in the form specified in clause 4.13.5; and

\(b\) an amount determined under clause 4.13.2(a) by the date and time
specified in clause 4.1.13.

4.13.1A For the purposes of this section 4.13, where an existing
Facility is undergoing significant maintenance or being upgraded the
requirement to provide Reserve Capacity Security applies only to the
part of the Facility either undergoing significant maintenance or being
upgraded.

4.13.1B. The obligation under clause 4.13.1 to provide Reserve Capacity
Security does not apply where the Market Participant has provided
Reserve Capacity Security in relation to the same Facility for a
previous Reserve Capacity Cycle, unless:

\(a\) the Facility is an existing Facility undergoing significant
maintenance or being upgraded; or

\(b\) AEMO cancelled the Capacity Credits assigned to the Facility for
that previous Reserve Capacity Cycle in accordance with clause 4.20.14.

4.13.1C For the purposes of this section 4.13, a Facility includes part
of a Facility, any upgrade or significant maintenance to an existing
Facility, unless otherwise stated.

4.13.2. For the purposes of this section 4.13 the amount of Reserve
Capacity Security is:

\(a\) at the time and date referred to in clause 4.1.13, 25 percent of
the Benchmark Reserve Capacity Price included in the Request for
Expressions of Interest issued for the relevant Reserve Capacity Cycle,
expressed in $/MW per year, multiplied by an amount equal to:

i\. the Certified Reserve Capacity assigned to the Facility; less

ii\. the total of any Certified Reserve Capacity amount specified in
accordance with clause 4.14.1(d) or referred to in clause 4.14.7(c)(ii);
and

\(b\) at the time and date referred to in clause 4.1.21, 25 percent of
the Benchmark Reserve Capacity Price included in the Request for
Expressions of Interest issued for the relevant Reserve Capacity Cycle,
expressed in $/MW per year, multiplied by an amount equal to the total
number of Capacity Credits assigned to the Facility under
clause 4.20.5A.

4.13.2A A Market Participant may apply to AEMO for a recalculation of
the amount of Reserve Capacity Security required to be held for a
Facility using the formula in clause 4.13.2(b) after the time and date
referred to in clause 4.1.21.

4.13.2B Within 10 Business Days after receipt of a request from a Market
Participant under clause 4.13.2A AEMO must recalculate the amount of
Reserve Capacity Security required to be held by a Facility using the
formula in clause 4.13.2(b). If the amount recalculated by AEMO under
clause 4.13.2(b) is less than that originally calculated under clause
4.13.2(a) then AEMO must:

\(a\) notify the Market Participant of the result of the calculation;

\(b\) offer the Market Participant the opportunity to replace the
Reserve Capacity Security in accordance with clause 4.13.2C, and

\(c\) if the Market Participant provides a replacement Reserve Capacity
Security in accordance with clause 4.13.2C, return any excess Reserve
Capacity Security.

4.13.2C Where under clause 4.13.2B AEMO notifies a Market Participant
that excess Reserve Capacity Security is currently held, then a Market
Participant may replace the existing Reserve Capacity Security with
replacement Reserve Capacity Security which must:

\(a\) be in the form specified in clause 4.13.5;

\(b\) be an amount not less than the amount required under clause
4.13.2(b); and

\(c\) become effective before AEMO returns any excess Reserve Capacity
Security.

4.13.3. Where a Market Participant’s existing Reserve Capacity Security
is due to expire or cease to have effect for any other reason and after
that expiration the Market Participant will continue to have an
obligation to ensure AEMO holds the benefit of a Reserve Capacity
Security under clause 4.13.1, then that Market Participant must ensure
that AEMO holds the benefit of replacement Reserve Capacity Security
that is:

\(a\) in the form specified in clause 4.13.5;

\(b\) an amount not less than the amount required under clause 4.13.2;
and

\(c\) effective when the existing Reserve Capacity Security expires or
otherwise ceases to have effect.

4.13A. DSM Reserve Capacity Security

4.13A.1. Where AEMO assigns Certified Reserve Capacity to a Demand Side
Programme, the relevant Market Participant must ensure that AEMO holds
the benefit of DSM Reserve Capacity Security that is:

\(a\) where:

i\. clause 4.1.13 applies, for an amount determined under clause
4.13A.2(a) by the date and time referred to in clause 4.1.13; or

ii\. clause 4.1.21 applies, for an amount determined under clause
4.13A.2(b) by the date and time referred to in clause 4.1.21; and

\(b\) in the form specified in clause 4.13A.6.

4.13A.2. For the purposes of this section 4.13A, the amount of DSM
Reserve Capacity Security is:

\(a\) 25 percent of the Benchmark Reserve Capacity Price included in the
Request for Expressions of Interest issued for the relevant Reserve
Capacity Cycle, expressed in $/MW per year, multiplied by an amount
equal to:

i\. the Certified Reserve Capacity assigned to the Demand Side
Programme; less

ii\. the total of any Certified Reserve Capacity amount specified in
accordance with clause 4.14.1(d) or referred to in clause 4.14.7(c)(ii);
or

\(b\) 25 percent of the Benchmark Reserve Capacity Price included in the
Request for Expressions of Interest issued for the relevant Reserve
Capacity Cycle, expressed in $/MW per year, multiplied by an amount
equal to the total number of Capacity Credits assigned to the Demand
Side Programme under clause 4.20.5A.

4.13A.3. Where:

\(a\) AEMO holds the benefit of a DSM Reserve Capacity Security in
accordance with this section 4.13A in respect of a Demand Side Programme
for a Reserve Capacity Cycle; and

\(b\) AEMO assigns Certified Reserve Capacity to the same Demand Side
Programme for a subsequent Reserve Capacity Cycle,

then the DSM Reserve Capacity Security for the previous Reserve Capacity
Cycle will be deemed to satisfy the requirement in clause 4.13A.1 for
AEMO to have the benefit of DSM Reserve Capacity Security for the
subsequent Reserve Capacity Cycle if:

\(c\) the amount of the DSM Reserve Capacity Security complies with
clause 4.13A.4; and

\(d\) the DSM Reserve Capacity Security remains in force at all relevant
times for the purposes of this section 4.13A.

4.13A.4. Subject to clause 4.13A.5, where a Market Participant is
required to ensure that AEMO holds the benefit of DSM Reserve Capacity
Security for more than one Reserve Capacity Cycle, the total amount of
the DSM Reserve Capacity Security for all of those Reserve Capacity
Cycles in aggregate is the highest amount determined under clause
4.13A.1.

4.13A.5. The amount determined under clause 4.13A.4 does not include
Reserve Capacity Cycles for which the Demand Side Programme does not
have any Reserve Capacity Obligations.

4.13A.6. The DSM Reserve Capacity Security for a Demand Side Programme
must be:

\(a\) an obligation in writing that:

i\. is from a Security Provider;

ii\. is a guarantee or bank undertaking in a form prescribed by AEMO;

iii\. is duly executed by the Security Provider and delivered
unconditionally to AEMO;

iv\. constitutes valid and binding unsubordinated obligations of the
Security Provider to pay to AEMO amounts in accordance with its terms
which relate to the relevant Market Participant’s obligations under the
WEM Rules to pay compensation under this section 4.13A; and

v\. permits drawings or claims by AEMO up to a stated amount; or

\(b\) if AEMO in its discretion considers it an acceptable alternative
in the circumstances to the obligation under clause 4.13A.6(a), a
Security Deposit.

4.13A.7. If, at any time, and for whatever reason, the amount of the DSM
Reserve Capacity Security is less than the amount determined in
accordance with clauses 4.13A.1 or 4.13A.4, as applicable, the Market
Participant must immediately:

\(a\) in the case of a DSM Reserve Capacity Security in the form
specified in clause 4.13A.6(a):

i\. replace the DSM Reserve Capacity Security for the amount determined
in accordance with clauses 4.13A.1 or 4.13A.4, as applicable; or

ii\. provide a further DSM Reserve Capacity Security for the difference
between the amount of the DSM Reserve Capacity Security and the amount
determined in accordance with clauses 4.13A.1 or 4.13A.4, as applicable,

and, in both cases, the DSM Reserve Capacity Security must comply with
clause 4.13A.6(a); or

\(b\) in the case of a Security Deposit, increase the amount of the
Security Deposit to the amount determined in accordance with clauses
4.13A.1 or 4.13A.4, as applicable, and do all other things AEMO may
require, including signing any deeds or other documents, to ensure AEMO
has the benefit of the increase in the amount of the Security Deposit.

4.13A.8. In respect of a Reserve Capacity Cycle, after the time and date
referred to in clause 4.1.23, a Market Participant may apply to AEMO for
a recalculation of the amount of DSM Reserve Capacity Security required
to be held for a Demand Side Programme under clauses 4.13A.1 or 4.13A.4,
as applicable.

4.13A.9. Within ten Business Days after receipt of a request from a
Market Participant under clause 4.13A.8, AEMO must recalculate the
amount of DSM Reserve Capacity Security required to be held for a Demand
Side Programme under clauses 4.13A.1 or 4.13A.4, as applicable. If the
amount recalculated by AEMO under clauses 4.13A.1 or 4.13A.4, as
applicable, is less than that previously calculated under clauses
4.13A.1 or 4.13A.4, as applicable, then AEMO must:

\(a\) notify the Market Participant of the result of the calculation;

\(b\) offer the Market Participant the opportunity to replace the DSM
Reserve Capacity Security in accordance with clause 4.13A.10, and

\(c\) if the Market Participant provides a replacement DSM Reserve
Capacity Security in accordance with clause 4.13A.10, return any excess
DSM Reserve Capacity Security.

4.13A.10. Where under clause 4.13A.9 AEMO notifies a Market Participant
that excess DSM Reserve Capacity Security is currently held, then a
Market Participant may replace the existing DSM Reserve Capacity
Security with replacement DSM Reserve Capacity Security which must:

\(a\) be in the form specified in clause 4.13A.6;

\(b\) be an amount not less than the amount required under clauses
4.13A.1 or 4.13A.4, as applicable; and

\(c\) become effective before AEMO returns any excess DSM Reserve
Capacity Security.

4.13A.11. Where a Market Participant’s existing DSM Reserve Capacity
Security is due to expire or cease to have effect for any reason and
after that expiration the Market Participant will continue to have an
obligation to ensure AEMO holds the benefit of DSM Reserve Capacity
Security under clause 4.13A.1, then the Market Participant must ensure
that AEMO holds the benefit of replacement DSM Reserve Capacity Security
that is:

\(a\) in the form specified in clause 4.13A.6;

\(b\) an amount not less than the amount required under clauses 4.13A.1
or 4.13A.4, as applicable; and

\(c\) effective when the existing DSM Reserve Capacity Security expires
or otherwise ceases to have effect.

4.13A.12. Where a Market Participant’s DSM Reserve Capacity Security is
affected by any of the circumstances specified in the WEM Procedure
referred to in clause 4.13A.23 that may require replacement DSM Reserve
Capacity Security, then the Market Participant must ensure that AEMO
holds the benefit of replacement DSM Reserve Capacity Security that is:

\(a\) in the form specified in clause 4.13A.6;

\(b\) an amount not less than the level required under clauses 4.13A.1
or 4.13A.4, as applicable; and

\(c\) effective before the end of the next Business Day or within any
longer period approved in writing by AEMO after the Market Participant
first becomes aware of the relevant change in circumstance (whether by
reason of the Market Participant’s own knowledge or a notification by
AEMO).

4.13A.13. Where DSM Reserve Capacity Security is provided as a Security
Deposit in accordance with clause 4.13A.6(b), it will accrue interest
daily at the AEMO Deposit Rate, and AEMO must pay the Market Participant
the interest accumulated at the end of each calendar month less any
liabilities and expenses incurred by AEMO, including bank fees and
charges.

4.13A.16. The payment obligation under clause 4.13A.15 may be satisfied
by AEMO drawing upon the DSM Reserve Capacity Security for the Demand
Side Programme, and applying the amount claimed (after meeting AEMO’s
costs associated with doing so) so as to:

\(a\) firstly, offset the cost of funding Supplementary Capacity

<th><p><strong>Explanatory Note</strong></p>
<p>Section 4.15 sets out the new Network Access Quantity
(<strong>NAQ</strong>) framework.</p>
<p>The NAQ:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>defines the network capacity, in MW, available to a Facility for
the purpose of determining the Capacity Credits that can be assigned to
the Facility up to the amount of its Certified Reserve Capacity;
and</p></li>
<li><p>establishes a preferential right to receive a Capacity Credit,
which can only be reduced in specific circumstances.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The primary purpose of the NAQ is to protect a Facility’s quantity of
Capacity Credits from an unhedgeable risk of being inefficiently
displaced by new entrant facilities connecting in constrained sections
of the network, where that additional capacity is not needed for system
reliability but is simply displacing an existing performing
resource.</p>
<p>The NAQ protects the investment in Facilities that continue to
participate in the RCM and meet all their performance obligations. A
Facility that, for reasons related to its own poor performance, fails to
provide its capacity to the RCM when required by the system surrenders
its ability to retain the unreliable portion of its NAQ. A Facility that
retires (or is mothballed or removed from service) must relinquish its
NAQ.</p>
<p>The NAQ is determined in relation to network capacity and is based on
the physical limits of the network. Hence, the NAQ serves as a cap on
the amount of Capacity Credits that can be assigned in specific regions
of the network. NAQ will be determined for a Facility up to the amount
of network capacity that can accommodate the Facility’s Certified
Reserve Capacity at peak times or other periods of low reserve. This
will ensure that the sum of NAQ determined for Facilities in specific
network regions (and in aggregate for the network as a whole) does not
exceed the transfer capability of the network.</p>
<p>Once NAQ is determined, new Facilities seeking to connect in a
specific region of the network can only receive NAQ up to the residual
capacity of the network in that region, after accounting for NAQ that
has already been determined.</p>
<p>A Facility’s NAQ can be reduced or increased due to ‘organic’ changes
that are beyond the control of the Facility i.e. due to changes in
demand, network configuration, or weather conditions for intermittent
facilities. The policy position is to afford these facilities a priority
for additional NAQ should conditions improve (ahead of other capacity).
This is intended to be implemented in the new framework by tracking a
‘Highest Network Access Quantity’ value.</p>
<p>The NAQ has no role in dispatch or settlement of the energy or ESS
markets, which will operate under the new Security Constrained Economic
Dispatch market model.</p>
<p>In accordance with the Miscellaneous Amendments No. 2, section 4.15
will be amended to '[Blank'] for the period from 1 March 2022 until the
amendments contained in the Tranches 2 and 3 Amendments (i.e. those set
out below) below commence on 1 September 2022.</p></th>

<tr class="header">
<th><p><strong>Explanatory Note</strong></p>
<p>Clause 4.15.1 requires AEMO to determine NAQs for relevant
Facilities.</p>
<p>A Facility’s NAQ is a function of:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>the Facility’s Certified Reserve Capacity; and</p></li>
<li><p>the network capacity that is available to accommodate the
Facility’s Certified Reserve Capacity.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Therefore, once AEMO has verified the performance capability of the
Facility (through the process of assigning Certified Reserve Capacity)
AEMO will then conduct an assessment (through a network capacity
modelling exercise) to determine how much of the Facility’s certified
output can be accommodated by the network.</p>
<p>Clause 4.15.5 will be replaced by the <em>Wholesale Electricity
Market Amendment (Tranche 5 Amendments) Rules 2021</em> (<strong>Tranche
5 Amendments</strong>) on 1 September 2022.</p>
<p>Tranche 6 Exposure Draft 1 included proposed amendments to ensure
that the facility dispatch scenarios developed by AEMO for use with the
Network Access Quantity Model consider Facilities with Early Certified
Reserve Capacity.</p>
<p>An additional issue with this clause was identified by AEMO after the
publication of Tranche 6 Exposure Draft 1. Depending on the relevant
Step in Appendix 3, a Facilities may be dispatched up to their Certified
Reserve Capacity or their Network Access Quantity assigned in the
previous Reserve Capacity Cycle. In the situation where either the total
assigned Certified Reserve Capacity or Network Access Quantities is less
than the peak demand it will be impossible for AEMO to satisfy clause
4.15.5(c).</p>
<p>For this reason, clause 4.15.5 is further amended to remove clause
4.15.5(c). How AEMO will create facility dispatch scenarios in a
shortfall situation will be covered in the Network Access Quantity WEM
Procedure.</p>
<p>Finally, following the consultation period for Tranche 6 Exposure
Draft 2, AEMO made a further suggestion to remove the requirement to
model NCESS for the creation of facility dispatch scenarios. AEMO
suggested to create Constraint Equations to ensure that during a solve,
the Facilities redispatch always meet the NCESS requirement. AEMO
considers that modelling the NCESS in the facility dispatch scenarios
may have an adverse impact that could result in overallocation of
Network Access Quantities to an NCESS Facility. In addition, the
solution using Constraint Equations is easier to implement and
consistent with the current design of the NAQ model.</p>
<p>In making its recommendation, AEMO (in consultation with Western
Power) considered whether it would be feasible to translate all possible
types of NCESS into Constraint Equations, considering the type of
constraint could be very different compared to Network thermal
constraints. AEMO and Western Power identified two scenarios where it
would not be possible to use a Constraint Equation to enforce an
NCESS:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>if the NCESS influences the dispatch of a Non Scheduled Facility
- note the NSF have a set dispatch value equal to their traded Certified
Reserve Capacity at any time, consistent with clause 4.15.9(d) that
requires AEMO to treat them as unconstrained; and</p></li>
<li><p>if the NCESS translates into a non-linear equation.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Both Western Power and AEMO do not foresee either of these scenarios
happening in the near future. In the event of an NCESS requiring either
the constraint of a NSF or to use a non-linear equation, AEMO would be
able to make modifications required to the NAQ model to account for it.
However, anticipating the design for this unlikely edge case would
require non-negligible effort and time and AEMO does not think this is
appropriate at this stage.</p></th>

assess any late responses;

\(b\) must consult with Western Power on any network access matters
related to the proposed Eligible Services specified in the responses in
accordance with the WEM Procedure referred to in clause.4.24.18; and

\(c\) must, for each response assessed by it, provide feedback to each
respondent on whether AEMO or Western Power, as applicable, consider the
Eligible Services they propose to provide would be capable of meeting
the requirements outlined in the call for expressions of interest and
contained in the standard Supplementary Capacity Contract.

4.24.2. If AEMO decides to seek to acquire supplementary capacity and:

\(a\) the expected start date of the shortfall is at least 12 weeks from
the date AEMO becomes aware of the shortfall, then it must call for
tenders from potential suppliers of supplementary capacity in an
invitation to tender;

\(b\) clause 4.24.2(a) does not apply, then it must either:

i\. call for tenders from potential suppliers of supplementary capacity
in an invitation to tender; or

ii\. negotiate directly with potential suppliers of supplementary
capacity.

4.24.3. The only eligible sources of supplementary capacity are the
following services (“**Eligible Services**”):

\(a\) load reduction, that is measures to reduce a consumer’s
consumption of electricity supplied through the SWIS from that which the
consumer would have otherwise consumed, but excluding reductions
provided by a Market Participant with a Demand Side Programme that does
not satisfy its Reserve Capacity Obligations during the current Capacity
Year or a previous Capacity Year;

\(b\) the production of electricity by Energy Producing Systems that are
not Registered Facilities; and

\(c\) the production of electricity by Energy Producing Systems that are
Registered Facilities, or load reductions provided by loads, but only to
the extent that the electricity is generated, or the load reduction is
provided, by capacity for which the relevant Market Participant, either:

i\. does not hold Capacity Credits in the current Capacity Year; and

ii\. has not held Capacity Credits in the current Capacity Year or a
previous Capacity Year; and

iii\. holds Capacity Credits in a subsequent Capacity Year,

or

iv\. provides evidence satisfactory to AEMO, prior to a Supplementary
Capacity Contract taking effect, that:

1\. costs have been incurred to enable the provision of the capacity
through the installation of physical equipment; and

2\. the capacity is in addition to the sent out capacity of the Energy
Producing Systems, or the maximum amount of load that can be curtailed,
that existed prior to the installation of the physical equipment.

4.24.4. A person is not required to be a Rule Participant in order to
submit a tender in response to a call for tenders under clause 4.24.2 or
enter into a Supplementary Capacity Contract with AEMO. However, if a
Rule Participant does enter into a Supplementary Capacity Contract with
AEMO, then it must comply with that contract.

4.24.5. AEMO must not call for tenders for supplementary capacity
earlier than six calendar months prior to the calendar month in which
the shortfall period is expected to start.

4.24.6. If AEMO decides to call for tenders for supplementary capacity,

> 4.25A. Verification Test for a Demand Side Programme

4.25A.1. In each Capacity Year each Market Participant must undertake a
Verification Test during the period specified in clause 4.10.1(f)(vi)
for each Demand Side Programme registered to the Market Participant.
Each test must be conducted in accordance with the WEM Procedure
specified in clause 4.25.14 and be carried out:

\(a\) within 20 Business Days of registration, as notified by AEMO under
clause 2.31.6, of the Demand Side Programme, if applicable; or

\(b\) between 1 October and 30 November.

4.25A.2. To undertake a Verification Test a Market Participant must
activate the Demand Side Programme and provide evidence satisfactory to
AEMO of the Trading Intervals during which the Verification Test was
conducted.

4.25A.3. A Demand Side Programme will be deemed to have failed the
Verification Test unless a reduction in demand equal to at least 10% of
the Capacity Credits, when measured against the Demand Side Programme’s
Relevant Demand determined under clause 4.26.2CA, is identified from the
Demand Side Programme Load associated with that Demand Side Programme.

4.25A.4. Where a Demand Side Programme fails a Verification Test AEMO
must reduce the Capacity Credits assigned to the Demand Side Programme
to zero from the second Trading Day following the Scheduling Day on
which AEMO determines that the Verification Test was failed under clause
4.25A.3.

4.25A.5. Where a Demand Side Programme fails a Verification Test the
relevant Market Participant may request that a second Verification Test
be undertaken. If the Demand Side Programme:

\(a\) fails the second Verification Test then the Capacity Credits
assigned to the Demand Side Programme are to remain at zero until the
end of the relevant Capacity Year; or

\(b\) does not fail the second Verification Test, from the second
Trading Day following the Scheduling Day on which the second
Verification Test was performed, the Capacity Credits assigned to the
Demand Side Programme are to be increased to the value applied to the
Demand Side Programme immediately prior to the first Verification Test.

4.26.1. If a Market Participant holding Capacity Credits associated with
a Facility fails to comply with its Reserve Capacity Obligations
applicable to any given Trading Interval then the Market Participant
must pay a refund to AEMO calculated in accordance with the following
provisions.

\(a\) The Trading Interval Refund Rate for a Facility f in the Trading
Interval t is determined as follows:

Trading Interval Refund Rate(f,t)=RF(f,t) × Y(f,t)

where:

i\. Trading Interval Refund Rate (f,t) is the Trading Interval Refund
Rate for a Facility f in the Trading Interval t;

ii\. RF(f,t) is the refund factor for a Facility f in the Trading
Interval t and is calculated in accordance with clause 4.26.1(c); and

iii\. Y(f,t) is the per Trading Interval capacity price associated with
a Facility f in the Trading Interval t and is determined in accordance
with clause 4.26.1(b).

\(b\) For a Facility f, for which a Market Participant holds Capacity

i\. where Facility f is not a Registered Facility in Trading Interval t,
Y(f,t) equals the Facility Monthly Reserve Capacity Price for the
Facility divided by the number of Trading Intervals in the Trading Month
in which Trading Interval t falls;

ii\. where AEMO has determined that in Trading Interval t Facility f is
not in Commercial Operation and is either a Scheduled Facility or
Semi-Scheduled Facility, Y(f,t) equals the Facility Monthly Reserve
Capacity Price for the Facility divided by the number of Trading
Intervals in the Trading Month in which Trading Interval t falls;

iii\. where AEMO has determined that in Trading Interval t Facility f is
in Commercial Operation and is either a Scheduled Facility or
Semi-Scheduled Facility, Y(f,t) is defined as:  
  
$$Y(f,\\t) = \frac{CCESR(f,\\t)}{CC(f,\\t)} \times \frac{FMRCP(f,\\t)}{8 \times TDTM(t)} + \frac{CC(f,\\t) - CCESR(f,\\t)}{CC(f,\\t)} \times \frac{FMRCP(f,\\t)}{TITM(t)}$$

Electric Storage Resources if Trading Interval t is within the Electric
Storage Resource Obligation Intervals for the Trading Day, and 0
otherwise;

Interval t;

3\. FMRCP(f,t) is the Facility Monthly Reserve Capacity Price for
Facility f in Trading Interval t;

4\. TDTM(t) is the number of Trading Days in the Trading Month in which
Trading Interval t falls; and

5\. TITM(t) is the number of Trading Intervals in the Trading Month in
which Trading Interval t falls;

iv\. where Facility f is a Non-Scheduled Facility, Y(f,t) equals the
Facility Monthly Reserve Capacity Price for the Facility divided by the
number of Trading Intervals in the relevant Trading Month in which
Trading Interval t falls; and

v\. where Facility f is a Demand Side Programme, Y(f,t) equals the
Reserve Capacity Price for the Facility divided by 400.

\(c\) The refund factor RF(f,t) for a Facility f in the Trading Interval
t is the lesser of:

i\. six; and

ii\. the greater of the dynamic refund factor RF dynamic(t) as
determined under clause 4.26.1(d) and the minimum refund factor
RFfloor(f,t) as determined under clauses 4.26.1(f) or 4.26.1(g) as
appropriate.

\(d\) The dynamic refund factor RF dynamic(t) in the Trading Interval t
is determined as follows:

$$\text{RF\\dynamic}\left( \text{t} \right)\text{\\}\text{=}\text{\\}\text{11.75}\text{\\}\text{-}\text{\\}\text{(}\\\frac{\text{5.75}}{\text{750}}\text{)}\text{\\}\text{×}\text{\\}\sum\_{\text{f}\text{∈}\text{F}}^{}\text{Spare(f,t)}$$

Participants hold Capacity Credits in the Trading Interval t and f is a
Facility within that set; and

ii\. Spare(f,t) is the available capacity related to the Registered
Facility f, which is not dispatched in the Trading Interval t determined
in accordance with clause 4.26.1(e).

\(e\) For a Registered Facility f in the Trading Interval t, Spare(f,t)
is determined as follows:

i\. where Facility f is a Scheduled Facility, the greater of zero and:

1\. the Reserve Capacity Obligation Quantity determined for the Facility
f in Trading Interval t; less

2\. the Capacity Adjusted Forced Outage Quantity for Facility f in
Trading Interval t calculated in 3.21.7B; less

2\. the Capacity Adjusted Forced Outage Quantity for Facility f in
Trading Interval t calculated in 3.21.7B; less

3\. the Sent Out Metered Schedule for Facility f in Trading Interval t
multiplied by two so as to be a MW quantity;

ii\. where Facility f is a Non-Scheduled Facility, zero; and

iii\. where Facility f is a Demand Side Programme in the Trading
Interval t, Spare(f,t) is equal to:

max{0,min(RCOQ(f,t), (DSP Load(f,t) - DSP MinLoad(f,t)))}

where:

1\. \[Blank\]

2\. RCOQ(f,t) is the Reserve Capacity Obligation for the Demand Side
Programme f in the Trading Interval t;

3\. DSP Load(f,t) is the Demand Side Programme Load for the Demand Side
Programme f in the Trading Interval t as determined under clause 9.5.4
multiplied by two so as to be a MW quantity; and

4\. DSP MinLoad(f,t) is the sum of the Minimum Consumption of each
Associated Load of the Demand Side Programme f in MW in the Trading
Interval t.

\(f\) Subject to clause 4.26.1(g), the minimum refund factor RF
floor(f,t) in the Trading Interval t is determined as follows:

RF floor(f,t) = 1 - 0.75 × Dispatchable(f,t)

where:

i\. Dispatchable(f,t) for a Facility f in the Trading Interval t is its
portion of capacity which is not subject to a Forced Outage over the
4320 previous Trading Intervals pt prior to and including the Trading
Interval t, where this is equal to one in the Trading Interval if no
Capacity Credits are held by the Facility in any of the 4320 previous

<p>Clause 4.29.1 is amended as a consequence of the deletion of the
Reserve Capacity Auction, and to remove redundant references to previous
Reserve Capacity Cycles.</p>
<p>Clause 4.29.1 (and section 4.29) was amended pursuant to RCM Pricing
Reforms to accommodate the changes to the price to be paid for Reserve
Capacity from the 2019 Reserve Capacity Cycle. To facilitate the pricing
reforms, the clause was restructured so that clause 4.29.1 calculates
the annual Reserve Capacity Price, instead of a Facility Monthly Reserve
Capacity Price which is now calculated in accordance with clause
4.29.1A.</p>
<p>As a result of the RCM Pricing Reforms and the deletion of the
Reserve Capacity Auction, Facilities will receive the same Reserve
Capacity Price except in two situations.</p>
<p>Firstly, if the Facility is a Transitional Facility and the Reserve
Capacity Cycle is a Transitional Reserve Capacity Cycle, the Reserve
Capacity Price for the Facility will be as determined in accordance with
clause 4.29.1B. A Transitional Facility is an existing Facility (other
than a DSP) that was assigned Capacity Credits in the 2018 Reserve
Capacity Cycle. A Transitional Facility will be assigned Capacity
Credits at the Reserve Capacity Price subject to a floor of $114,000 and
a cap of $140,000. The cap and floor prices will be escalated in each of
the subsequent nine Reserve Capacity Cycles (i.e. up to and including
the 2028 Reserve Capacity Cycle) by the Reserve Bank of Australia's
Statement of Monetary Policy forecast Consumer Price Index for June of
Year 3 of the relevant Reserve Capacity Cycle in accordance with clause
4.29.1C.</p>
<p>Secondly, if the Facility is a Fixed Price Facility and the Reserve
Capacity Cycle is a Fixed Price Reserve Capacity Cycle for that Fixed
Price Facility, the Reserve Capacity Price for the Facility will be the
value determined in accordance with clause 4.29.1D. A Fixed Price
Facility is a Facility that will be assigned Capacity Credits at the
Reserve Capacity Price in the first Reserve Capacity Cycle in which it
is classified as a Fixed Price Facility. That Reserve Capacity Price
will be escalated in each of the subsequent four Reserve Capacity Cycles
by the Reserve Bank of Australia's Statement of Monetary Policy forecast
Consumer Price Index for June of Year 3 of the relevant Reserve Capacity
Cycle.</p>
<p>Upgrades of Facilities will receive the same Reserve Capacity Price
as the parent Facility unless the upgrade is a separate Facility for the
purposes of the WEM Rules. The main reason for this approach is the
absence of separate metering for the parent Facility and any associated
upgrade.</p>

from chapter 9 (sections 9.4 and 9.5) to Chapter 4, changes in taxonomy,
change to clause references in Chapter 9. Changes also made to provide
clarity to Market Participants regarding the cut-off time.</p>
<p>The clause numbering in new sections 4.30 and 4.31 is consistent with
the numbering in sections 9.4 and 9.5.</p>
<p>Capacity Credit Allocations have changed from a monthly process which
was included in the consultation. AEMO identified implementation issues
where the monthly CCA would be effected by a transfer or reduction in
capacity credits late in the month which would have an impact on prior
trading week settlement.</p>
<p>Section 4.30 has been further amended as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The rules permit a participant to revise a CCA; however, they do
not require AEMO to check they have sufficient Capacity Credits to make
the revision. [4.30.6]. This undermines a key rule concept.</p></li>
<li><p>The rules allow participants to amend CCAs after the termination
of Capacity Credits; however, there are existing concepts that would
allow participants to do this (by withdrawing a CCA and submitting
another one). [4.30.10]. The current rule drafting for Capacity Credit
Allocation amendments adds implementation complexity for no benefit to
the market.</p></li>
<li><p>The rules put a 2 day deadline for CCA amendments to be resolved.
This was previously important, as changes to CCAs would impact a Market
Participant’s Trading Margin, and therefore is time-sensitive; however,
this is no longer the case. [4.30.10 and 4.30.11] The current rule
drafting for resolving Capacity Credit Allocation amendments within 2
days adds implementation complexity for no benefit to the
market.</p></li>
<li><p>The rules put a requirement for AEMO to amend CCAs by 5PM on the
Scheduling Day if a participant does not amend the CCAs by 5PM on the
Scheduling Day. [4.30.11] This makes it impossible for AEMO to comply
with the obligation by amending them exactly at 5PM on the Scheduling
Day.</p></li>
<li><p>The current drafting also explicitly refers to terminations
identified in clause 4.30.9. It should be written more generally to
consider any situation where the CCAs for a Facility exceed the Capacity
Credits (e.g. where a Facility is transferred, the outgoingl Facility
owner having CCAs for a Facility they no longer own).</p></li>

<th><p><strong>Explanatory Note</strong></p>
<p>Chapter 6 is to be renamed ‘The Short Term Energy Market’ and will be
limited to matters relating only to the Short Term Energy Market
(<strong>STEM</strong>).</p>
<p>The STEM is a financially binding day-ahead market. STEM provides a
centrally coordinated opportunity for Market Participants to trade
around their bilateral positions, supplementing and complementing the
off-market bilateral contracts regime. It allows for financial trading
against contract positions, rather than centralised scheduling and
commitment, though it does provide a firm financial basis for commitment
of long-start-time Registered Facilities.</p>
<p>The changes focus on four main aspects:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>removing narrow windows and timings for AEMO and Market
Participants to submit information, in favour of continuously updated
information from AEMO, and flexibility for Market Participants to submit
information at their convenience;</p></li>
<li><p>Market Participants will now use data from the Pre-Dispatch
Schedules to bound their STEM submissions, replacing the current
requirement for AEMO to calculate certain information daily for use in
the STEM;</p></li>
<li><p>adjusting the present requirement to offer in at short-run
marginal cost where the Market Participant has market power, to
explicitly allow incorporation of a risk premium where a Market
Participant is uncertain of its ability to generate, including for
projected ESS provision; and</p></li>
<li><p>removing the requirement for Market Participants to lock-in
energy to meet their Net Bilateral Position in the STEM, allowing Market
Participants to leave some of their position open until the Real-Time
Market.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>As a result of Chapter 6 being limited to matters relating only to
the STEM, further amendments are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>sections 6.1 to 6.11 (STEM) will be retained subject to
amendments in these WEM Rules to reflect the changes outlined
above;</p></li>
<li><p>sections 6.11A and 6.12 (Non-Balancing Dispatch) are deleted and
replaced by new arrangements in the Central Dispatch Process in Chapter
7;</p></li>
<li><p>sections 6.13 and 6.14 (Settlement quantities) will be retained
subject to amendments to Settlement (Chapter 9);</p></li>
<li><p>section 6.15 (TES) is deleted as part of the amendments to
Settlement (Chapter 9);</p></li>
<li><p>section 6.16 (Metered Schedule) will be retained subject to
amendments to Settlement (Chapter 9);</p></li>
<li><p>sections 6.16A, 6.16B and clauses 6.17.3 to 6.17.5C (Out of Merit
and Constrained Payments) are deleted and replaced by uplift payments
and other amendments to Settlement (Chapter 9);</p></li>
<li><p>clauses 6.17.1 and 6.17.2 (Balancing Settlement Quantities) are
retained and renamed, and adjusted for the new Real-Time Market as
reflected in Settlement (Chapter 9);</p></li>
<li><p>clauses 6.17.6 to 6.17.8 (Non-Balancing Facility dispatch
payments) are deleted pursuant to amendments to Settlement (Chapter 9)
(and changes relating to the Reserve Capacity Mechanism that are
scheduled to commence on 1 October 2021);</p></li>
<li><p>clause 6.17.9 (Settlement Tolerance) is retained and moved to
Chapter 9 pursuant to the amendments to Settlement (Chapter 9);</p></li>
<li><p>clause 6.17.10 and section 6.18 (Portfolio Settlement Tolerance)
is deleted (as the portfolio will no longer exist under the new market
arrangements) pursuant to the amendments to Settlement (Chapter
9);</p></li>
<li><p>section 6.19 (Market Advisories) is deleted and merged with
Dispatch Advisories to create new Market Advisories in section
7.11;</p></li>
<li><p>section 6.20 (Energy Price Limits) is retained subject to
amendments pursuant to the amendments in the Market Power workstream;
and</p></li>
<li><p>section 6.21 (Settlement Data) is retained subject to amendments
to Settlement (Chapter 9).</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Various clauses in Chapter 6 are also amended to reflect the Amending
Rules contained in the Rule Change Panel's Final Report for Rule Change
Proposal RC_2014_03 (Administrative Improvements to the Outage
Process).</p>
<p>However, as this companion version of the WEM Rules only shows the
Tranches 2 and 3 Amendments as those amending rules (made by the
Minister at the date this companion version was prepared) will be
commenced last, please refer to the Final Report for Rule Change
Proposal RC_2014_03 (Administrative Improvements to the Outage Process)
to see the changes that will commence on 29 June 2021 and apply until
the relevant clauses in the Tranches 2 and 3 Amendments

Interval under clause 6.3B.1C:

\(a\) If the cumulative MWh quantity over all Price-Quantity Pairs in

for the Market Participant for the Trading Interval which was determined
on the current Scheduling Day under clause 6.3A.3(e), the Price-Quantity
Pairs must be adjusted downward so that the cumulative MWh quantity over
all the Price‑Quantity Pairs equals the Maximum Supply Capability. This
must be achieved by deleting successively or reducing the highest price
Price‑Quantity Pairs until the cumulative MWh quantity over all
remaining Price‑Quantity Pairs equals the Maximum Supply Capability.

\(b\) If the cumulative MWh quantity over all Price-Quantity Pairs in
the Portfolio Demand Curve is greater than the Maximum Consumption
Capability for the Market Participant for the Trading Interval which was
determined on the current Scheduling Day under clause 6.3A.3(f), the
Price-Quantity Pairs must be adjusted downward so that the cumulative
MWh quantity over all the Price‑Quantity Pairs equals the Maximum
Consumption Capability. This must be achieved by deleting successively
or reducing the highest price Price‑Quantity Pairs until the cumulative
MWh quantity over all remaining Price‑Quantity Pairs equals the Maximum
Consumption Capability.

\(c\) If the price in any Price-Quantity Pair in the Portfolio Supply
Curve or Portfolio Demand Curve is greater than the Energy Offer Price
Ceiling which will apply (or which AEMO expects will apply) in the
Trading Interval, the price in the Price-Quantity Pair must be replaced
by the Energy Offer Price Ceiling which will apply (or which AEMO
expects will apply) in the Trading Interval.

\(d\) If the price in any Price-Quantity Pair in the Portfolio Supply
Curve or Portfolio Demand Curve is less than the Energy Offer Price
Floor which will apply (or which AEMO expects will apply) in the Trading
Interval, the price in the Price-Quantity Pair must be replaced by the
Energy Offer Price Floor which will apply (or which AEMO expects will
apply) in the Trading Interval.

\(e\) \[Blank\]

\(f\) If multiple Price-Quantity Pairs in the Portfolio Supply Curve
share the same price, they must be replaced with a single Price-Quantity
Pair for that price with a MWh quantity equal to the sum of the MWh
quantities in the Price-Quantity Pairs which are being replaced.

\(g\) If multiple Price-Quantity Pairs in the Portfolio Demand Curve
share the same price, they must be replaced with a single Price-Quantity
Pair for that price with a MWh quantity equal to the sum of the MWh
quantities in the Price-Quantity Pairs which are being replaced.

To avoid doubt, the process steps specified in this clause 6.3B.2 must
be performed in the order listed, and a reference to a Portfolio Supply
Curve or Portfolio Demand Curve in those clauses is a reference to the
Portfolio Supply Curve or Portfolio Demand Curve as adjusted by any
earlier steps in the process.

6.3B.3. Where AEMO receives STEM Submission data from a Market
Participant under clause 6.3B.1, AEMO must, as soon as practicable after

<th><p><strong>Explanatory Note</strong></p>
<p>The structure of Chapter 7 reflects the integration of the operation
of the Real-Time Market and the Central Dispatch Process in accordance
with the Security Constrained Economic Dispatch (<strong>SCED</strong>)
market model.</p>
<p>More specifically:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Chapter 7 is renamed ‘Real-Time Market Operation and Dispatch’
and substantially amended; and</p></li>
<li><p>Chapters 7A and 7B are deleted.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>As the name implies, SCED determines the most economic dispatch of
individual resources across the SWIS. In the current market, AEMO
schedules energy and Essential System Services separately, and
congestion on the network is accounted for by amendments to the market
dispatch.</p>
<p>The adoption of the SCED market model, which includes consideration
of network constraints in the calculation of dispatch schedules, is
essential for the SWIS in order to maintain system security as
congestion increases. Adopting the SCED market model will require AEMO
to replace the existing market and dispatch systems that it uses to
operate the Wholesale Electricity Market.</p>
<p>Adopting a SCED market model is fundamental to realising the benefits
of the sustainable and efficient management of network constraints, and
is expected to deliver the following benefits.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>transparent determination of the least-cost dispatch outcome for
the market, accounting for generation offers and network conditions, and
allowing Market Participants to respond, resulting in increased
competition in the Real-Time Market and a downward pressure on the
energy price over time;</p></li>
<li><p>greater automation in the calculation of network constraints,
which improves network efficiency by allowing constraints to be set less
conservatively without compromising system reliability; and</p></li>
<li><p>greater automation in the dispatch process, so that system
security can be managed efficiently as the level of constraints
increases, and the generation mix continues to change.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>However, various clauses in Chapter 7 are also amended by the October
2021 RCM Pricing Amendments, including as a result of tranche based
dispatch payments for DSPs ceasing from the 2019 Reserve Capacity Cycle
(i.e. from the 2021 Capacity Year), the Tranche 1 Amendments, the
Miscellaneous Amendments No. 1 and the Amending Rules contained in the
Rule Change Panel's Final Report for Rule Change Proposal RC_2014_03

<p>Several clauses in Chapter 7 of the current WEM Rules have also been
amended by the Tranche 5 Amendments (Schedule B). However, as this
Chapter 7 reflects the amendments that will apply from the start of the
new market, please refer to the Tranche 5 Amendments to see the
amendments to those clauses that will apply until that time.</p>
<p>The key changes proposed to the Real-Time Market arrangements in
Chapter 7 pursuant to the Tranche 6 Amendments include:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>changes to the rules around the provision and use of Injection

<li><p>clauses 7.4.54 to 7.4.62 – Standing Submissions.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>An overview of the main changes affecting section 7.4 is provided
below.</p>
<p><strong>Changes to Real-Time Market Submission terminology and
processing rules</strong></p>
<p>Section 7.4 has been amended to clarify the definitions of “Real-Time
Market Submission” and “Standing Real-Time Market Submission” and the
general processing rules for these submissions. Under the proposed
changes:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>A Real-Time Market Submission relates to a Registered Facility,
Market Service and Dispatch Interval.</p></li>
<li><p>A Market Participant may include multiple Real-Time Market
Submissions in a single electronic submission. AEMO will either accept
the electronic submission (and all the Real-Time Market Submissions
within it) or reject the electronic submission (and all the Real-Time
Market Submissions within it).</p></li>
<li><p>A Standing Real-Time Market Submission is a default Real-Time
Market Submission for a Registered Facility and Market Service for
Dispatch Intervals starting at specified times on Trading Days of a
specified type.</p></li>
<li><p>A Market Participant may include multiple Standing Real-Time
Market Submissions in a single electronic submission, but must ensure
that the Standing Real-Time Market Submissions in an electronic
submission for a Registered Facility and Market Service, in combination,
uniquely specify the default Real-Time Market Submission to apply for
each Dispatch Interval in a generic Trading Week.</p></li>
<li><p>At any point in time, the Real-Time Market Submission for a
Registered Facility, Market Service and Dispatch Interval is the
(variation) Real-Time Market Submission most recently accepted by AEMO
under clause 7.4.49(a)(i), or, if no such submission exists, the most
recently accepted applicable Standing Real-Time Market
Submission.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Changes to the provision and use of Injection and Withdrawal
forecasts for Semi-Scheduled Facilities and Non-Scheduled
Facilities</strong></p>
<p>Previously, a Market Participant was required to ensure that the sum
of the quantities in the Price-Quantity Pairs for Injection in its
Semi-Scheduled Facility Real-Time Market Submission was equal to the
Market Participant’s unconstrained Injection forecast for the Facility.
While this arrangement provided an Injection forecast to AEMO, it could
also restrict the level to which the Facility could be dispatched,
because of the absence of Price-Quantity Pairs covering Injection levels
above the Market Participant’s forecast. Additionally, the arrangement
did not support the provision of Withdrawal forecasts.</p>
<p>Under the proposed new arrangements, the quantities in the
Price-Quantity Pairs for energy for a Semi-Scheduled Facility or
Non-Scheduled Facility should sum to the maximum quantity that the
Market Participant considers the Facility could Inject/Withdraw assuming
it was not constrained by AEMO (including on price), i.e. assuming no
shortage of any intermittent fuel such as wind. The Market Participant
will also include an Unconstrained Injection Forecast and Unconstrained
Withdrawal Forecast, defined as follows, in each Real-Time Market
Submission:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Unconstrained Injection Forecast</strong>: The expected
MW level of Injection at the end of a Dispatch Interval for a
Semi-Scheduled Facility or Non-Scheduled Facility, assuming that the
Facility will not be subject to a Dispatch Instruction or direction from
AEMO that limits its Injection, and allowing for expected conditions,
commitment and control intentions and the effect of any Outages that
have not been rejected for the Facility.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Unconstrained Withdrawal Forecast</strong>: The expected
MW level of Withdrawal at the end of a Dispatch Interval for a
Semi-Scheduled Facility or Non-Scheduled Facility, assuming that the
Facility will not be subject to a Dispatch Instruction or direction from
AEMO that limits its Withdrawal, and allowing for expected conditions,
commitment and control intentions and the effect of any Outages that
have not been rejected for the Facility</p></li>
</ul>
<p>AEMO may use the Unconstrained Injection Forecasts and Unconstrained
Withdrawal Forecasts provided in Real-Time Market Submissions as inputs
to the Dispatch Algorithm, but may also use alternative forecasts if it
reasonably considers they are likely to be more accurate.</p>
<p>Price-Quantity Pairs will continue to be used within the Dispatch
Algorithm to determine Dispatch Caps for Semi-Scheduled Facilities.
However, Semi-Scheduled Facilities will not be constrained where their
Unconstrained Injection Forecasts or Unconstrained Withdrawal Forecasts
are lower than the cleared Price-Quantity Pairs.</p>
<p><strong>Changes to Real-Time Market Submission obligations for
Non-Scheduled Facilities</strong>:</p>
<p>It is important for AEMO to have visibility of a Non-Scheduled
Facility’s intentions to support the production of forward-looking
Market Schedules and provide overall transparency to the market. For
this reason, Market Participants will be required to submit Real-Time
Market Submissions for their Non-Scheduled Facilities.</p>
<p>The submission requirements for Non-Scheduled Facilities have been
separated from the requirements for the Registered Facilities being
actively dispatched by AEMO through the Dispatch Algorithm (Scheduled
Facilities, Semi-Scheduled Facilities and Interruptible Loads). The
Market Participant must declare its intentions (either Injection or
Withdrawal) by including a single Price-Quantity Pair at the price
cap/floor. The Market Participant will also provide an Unconstrained
Injection Forecast and Unconstrained Withdrawal Forecast for each
Dispatch Interval.</p>
<p>These inputs will be used in the Dispatch Algorithm to account for
the expected impact of Non‑Scheduled Facilities, and will be included in
the publication requirements to support transparency.</p>
<p>While Market Participants will be required to make Real-Time Market
Submissions for Non-Scheduled Facilities, they will have a lower
threshold for updating their submissions to reflect that they are not
actively dispatched. The obligation to maintain accurate forecast
quantities for a Non-Scheduled Facility will not attract civil
penalties, and the requirement to update forecast quantities is reduced
to when information supporting underlying expectations has significantly
changed or the Market Participant is knowingly intervening in the
operation of the Facility (e.g. has specific knowledge about Outages,
commitment or control intentions of behind-the-meter components), as
provided for under new clause 7.4.37A.</p>
<p><strong>Relocation of provisions relating to Demand Side Programme
submissions:</strong></p>
<p>The provisions relating to DSP Withdrawal Profile Submissions and
Standing DSP Withdrawal Profile Submissions have been moved from section
7.4 to a new section 7.4A.</p></th>

Real-Time Market Submissions – Processing

7.4.50. AEMO must convert the prices in a Real-Time Market Submission
for energy into Loss Factor Adjusted Prices, and must use those Loss
Factor Adjusted Prices in the Dispatch Algorithm.

7.4.51. Where a Loss Factor Adjusted Price determined in accordance with
clause 7.4.50 is outside the relevant Energy Offer Cap, AEMO must use
the relevant Energy Offer Cap for the Real-Time Market Submission in the
Dispatch Algorithm.

7.4.51A. Where a price in a Real-Time Market Submission for a Frequency
Co-optimised Essential System Service:

\(a\) is greater than the relevant FCESS Offer Price Ceiling, AEMO must
use the relevant FCESS Offer Price Ceiling in the Dispatch Algorithm;
and

\(b\) is less than zero, AEMO must use a price of zero in the Dispatch
Algorithm.

7.4.52. Where AEMO determines, based on the information available to it
at the relevant time, that the capability of a Registered Facility to
provide an Essential System Service differs from the quantities and
technical parameters specified in the most recently submitted Real-Time
Market Submission for the Registered Facility for the relevant Dispatch
Interval, AEMO may adjust the following inputs to reflect the
information available to it at that time, for use in the Dispatch
Algorithm:

\(a\) Enablement Minimum;

\(b\) Enablement Maximum;

\(c\) Low Breakpoint; and

\(d\) High Breakpoint.

7.4.52A. Where AEMO adjusts inputs under clause 7.4.52, AEMO must, as
soon as practicable, make the adjusted inputs and the reasons for the
adjustment available to the Market Participant.

7.4.53. AEMO must document in a WEM Procedure:

\(a\) the information and processes, including the application of any
formulae, AEMO will use in making a determination under clause 7.4.52;
and

\(b\) the circumstances in which AEMO will adjust the inputs specified

<p>Feedback from AEMO’s implementation program identified a number of
issues with the proposal to include Demand Side Programmes in the
Dispatch Algorithm, including:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>the potential for inaccurate identification of potential Demand
Side Programme dispatch in the forward Market Schedules;</p></li>
<li><p>issues with the proposed tie-breaking approach; and</p></li>
<li><p>issues relating to the need to take into account the specific
restrictions associated with the dispatch of Demand Side Programmes,
e.g. notice periods, hours available for dispatch, maximum hours of
dispatch per year, etc).</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Due to these issues, Demand Side Programmes will not be dispatched
using the Dispatch Algorithm. Instead, an alternative approach has been
developed for the dispatch of these Facilities.</p>
<p>A key component of this approach is the requirement for Market
Participants to provide DSP Withdrawal Profile Submissions that specify
two forecast quantities for each Dispatch Interval:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>a DSP Unconstrained Withdrawal Quantity, which is the Market
Participant’s estimate of the average MW consumption of its Demand Side
Programme in the Dispatch Interval assuming that the Demand Side
Programme is not affected by any Dispatch Instruction or Reserve
Capacity Test; and</p></li>
<li><p>a DSP Constrained Withdrawal Quantity, which the DSP
Unconstrained Withdrawal Quantity adjusted to take into account the
impact of any impending dispatch or Reserve Capacity Tests about which
the Market Participant has been advised.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The two values are expected to be identical for most Dispatch
Intervals.</p>
<p>New section 7.4A sets out the obligations with respect to DSP

7.4A. DSP Withdrawal Profile Submissions

7.4A.1. A Market Participant must ensure that it has made a DSP
Withdrawal Profile Submission or Standing DSP Withdrawal Profile
Submission in accordance with this section 7.4A for each Dispatch
Interval in the Week-Ahead Schedule Horizon for each of its Demand Side
Programmes.

7.4A.2. If AEMO has not accepted a DSP Withdrawal Profile Submission for
a Demand Side Programme and Dispatch Interval under clause 7.4A.15(a),
but has accepted an applicable Standing DSP Withdrawal Profile
Submission, then the Standing DSP Withdrawal Profile Submission is
deemed to be the DSP Withdrawal Profile Submission for the Demand Side
Programme and Dispatch Interval.

7.4A.3. A DSP Withdrawal Profile Submission for a Demand Side Programme
and Dispatch Interval that AEMO accepts under clause 7.4A.15(a) replaces
any previously accepted DSP Withdrawal Profile Submission for, and has
effect in relation to, the Demand Side Programme and Dispatch Interval.

7.4A.4. If:

\(a\) AEMO has not yet accepted a DSP Withdrawal Profile Submission for
a Demand Side Programme and Dispatch Interval under clause 7.4A.15(a);
and

\(b\) AEMO accepts a Standing DSP Withdrawal Profile Submission for the
Demand Side Programme that is applicable to the Dispatch Interval,

then the Standing DSP Withdrawal Profile Submission replaces any
previously accepted Standing DSP Withdrawal Profile Submission as the
deemed DSP Withdrawal Profile Submission for the Demand Side Programme
and Dispatch Interval.

\(a\) as soon as practicable review, and if necessary update, the DSP
Withdrawal Profile Submissions for the Demand Side Programme for,
subject to clause 7.4A.9A, each future Dispatch Interval before the end
of the Trading Day in which the period specified under clause
7.11.6(cA)(ii) falls; and

\(b\) for the purposes of determining DSP Constrained Withdrawal
Quantities, assume the Demand Side Programme will be subject to Dispatch
Instructions that curtail the Withdrawal of the Demand Side Programme by
the maximum quantity consistent with its Reserve Capacity Obligations
for the period specified under clause 7.11.6(cA)(ii).

7.4A.6. If AEMO issues a Dispatch Instruction with a non-zero MW
quantity to a Demand Side Programme under clause 7.6.15, then the Market
Participant must:

\(a\) as soon as practicable and no later than one hour before the
Dispatch Interval from which the Dispatch Instruction applies, review,

Demand Side Programme for, subject to clause 7.4A.9A, each future
Dispatch Interval before the end of the Trading Day in which the
Dispatch Interval specified under clause 7.6.11A(c) falls; and

\(b\) for the purposes of determining the applicable DSP Constrained

Programme and assume that AEMO will issue a Dispatch Instruction with a
zero MW quantity that will apply from the Dispatch Interval specified
under clause 7.6.11A(e).

7.4A.7. If AEMO issues a Dispatch Instruction with a zero MW quantity to
a Demand Side Programme under clause 7.6.15, then the Market Participant
must:

\(a\) as soon as practicable and no later than one hour before the
Dispatch Interval from which the Dispatch Instruction applies, review,

Reserve Capacity Test of a Demand Side Programme under clause 4.25.9(h),
the Market Participant must:

\(a\) as soon as practicable and no later than one hour before the
Reserve Capacity Test is due to commence, review and update the DSP
Withdrawal Profile Submissions for the Demand Side Programme for,

Day in which Reserve Capacity Test will be conducted; and

\(b\) take the information provided in the notification under clause
4.25.9(h) into account in determining the relevant DSP Constrained

7.4A.9. A Market Participant must make reasonable endeavours to ensure
that when any of the conditions specified in clauses 7.4A.5, 7.4A.6,
7.4A.7 or 7.4A.8 apply, the DSP Unconstrained Withdrawal Quantities and
DSP Constrained Withdrawal Quantities in its DSP Withdrawal Profile
Submissions for the Demand Side Programme accurately reflect the Market
Participant’s reasonable expectation of the Withdrawal of the Demand
Side Programme during the applicable Dispatch Intervals under the
required assumptions.

7.4A.9A. For the purposes of updating DSP Withdrawal Profile Submissions
under clauses 7.4A.5, 7.4A.6, 7.4A.7 or 7.4A.8, a Market Participant
must not include a future Dispatch Interval in its updated DSP
Withdrawal Profile Submissions, where the Market Participant reasonably

AEMO Control of Registered Facilities

7.6.28. AEMO may, where required for a Registered Facility or equipment
to participate in the Central Dispatch Process, or to provide an
Essential System Service, or otherwise by agreement with a Market
Participant, control specified operations of a Registered Facility or
equipment, including:

\(a\) the starting, loading and stopping of one or more of the Market

\(a\) does not remove AEMO’s obligation to record Dispatch Instructions
for those Registered Facilities; and

\(b\) does not affect or modify a Market Participant’s rights and
obligations in respect of a Registered Facility under these WEM Rules.
To avoid doubt, notwithstanding AEMO’s operational control, a Market

Dispatch Compliance

7.10. Compliance with Dispatch Instructions

7.10.1. A Market Participant must comply with the following in the most
recently issued Dispatch Instruction applicable to its Scheduled
Facility, Semi-Scheduled Facility or Interruptible Load for the Dispatch
Interval:

\(a\) the Dispatch Target or Dispatch Cap as applicable;

\(b\) Essential System Service Enablement Quantities; and

\(c\) Ramp Rate.

7.10.1A. A Market Participant must comply with the most recently issued
Dispatch Instruction applicable to its Demand Side Programme in a
Dispatch Interval.

7.10.1 if:

\(a\) such compliance would endanger the safety of any person, damage
equipment or breach any applicable law;

\(b\) the actual Injection or Withdrawal of the Registered Facility does
not, at any time the Dispatch Instruction applies:

i\. vary, by more than the applicable Tolerance Range or Facility
Tolerance Range, from a linear profile between the Injection or
Withdrawal of the Facility at the start of the Dispatch Interval and the
Dispatch Target at:

1\. the time at which the Dispatch Target would be reached by ramping at
the ramp rate specified in the Dispatch Instruction; or

2\. if no ramp rate is specified in the Dispatch Instruction, the end of
the Dispatch Interval;

ii\. exceed by more than the applicable Tolerance Range or Facility
Tolerance Range a linear profile between the Injection or Withdrawal of
the Facility at the start of the Dispatch Interval and the Dispatch Cap

1\. the time at which the Dispatch Cap would be reached by ramping at
the ramp rate specified in the Dispatch Instruction; or

2\. if no ramp rate is specified in the Dispatch Instruction, the end of
the Dispatch Interval;

\(c\) both of the following apply:

i\. the Market Participant notifies AEMO, in accordance with clause
3.21.2(a), that its Registered Facility has been affected by or will be
affected by a Forced Outage; and

ii\. the quantity of the relevant Remaining Available Capacity for the
Forced Outage notified is consistent with the extent to which the Market
Participant did not comply with the most recently issued Dispatch
Instruction applicable to its Registered Facility for the Dispatch
Interval;

\(d\) the Registered Facility has been granted permission under clause
7.10.14 to ramp at a fixed rate, complies with the Dispatch Target or
Dispatch Cap, as relevant, and ramps at the ramp rate specified in the
Real-Time Market Submission for the Registered Facility;

\(e\) AEMO was unable to issue Dispatch Instructions to a Fast Start
Facility in accordance with clause 7.6.32(b), and that Facility is
responding according to its Dispatch Inflexibility Profile; or

\(f\) the Market Participant was conducting a Commissioning Test on a
Facility as part of an approved Commissioning Test Plan, and was unable
to comply with clause 7.10.1 in a Dispatch Interval due to a failure of
the Facility’s equipment.

Price Determination

7.11A. Price Determination Principles

7.11A.1. The principles applying to the determination of prices in the
Real-Time Market are:

\(a\) subject to this section 7.11A, a Market Clearing Price at the
Reference Node is determined by AEMO using the Central Dispatch Process
for each Dispatch Interval;

\(b\) a Reference Trading Price is determined by AEMO as the
time-weighted average of the Market Clearing Prices for energy for each
Dispatch Interval in a Trading Interval;

\(c\) Registered Facilities which operate in accordance with a direction
in the Central Dispatch Process are to be taken into account by AEMO,
but AEMO must not use the applicable Real-Time Market Offers or
Real-Time Market Bids for those Registered Facilities in the calculation
of the Market Clearing Price for the relevant Market Service in the
relevant Dispatch Interval;

\(d\) where a Registered Facility is Inflexible, AEMO must take the
Inflexibility of the Registered Facility into account in the Central
Dispatch Process, but must not use the price in the Real-Time Market
Offer or Real-Time Market Bid for that Registered Facility for the
applicable Market Service in the calculation of the Market Clearing
Price for that Market Service in the relevant Dispatch Interval;

\(e\) Loss Factors and Constraint Equations are to be taken into account
by AEMO in the calculation of Market Clearing Prices;

\(f\) where the Injection or Withdrawal of a Registered Facility is
limited above or below the level at which it would otherwise have been
dispatched by AEMO on the basis of its Real-Time Market Offer or
Real-Time Market Bid for energy due to a Constraint Equation included in
the Dispatch Algorithm under clause 7.5.8(a):

i\. the Registered Facility’s Real-Time Market Offer or Real-Time Market
Bid for energy, as applicable, is to be taken into account by AEMO in
the determination of dispatch, but the Real-Time Market Offer or
Real-Time Market Bid, as applicable, is not to be used by AEMO in the
calculation of the Market Clearing Price for energy in the relevant
Dispatch Interval; and

ii\. the Registered Facility’s Real-Time Market Submissions for other
Frequency Co-optimised Essential System Services are to be used by AEMO
in the determination of dispatch and taken into account in determining
the Market Clearing Prices for those Market Services;

\(g\) subject to section 9.9, AEMO must apply the Reference Trading
Price to both sales and purchases of energy in the relevant Trading
Interval;

\(h\) when a Market Clearing Price is determined for a Frequency
Co-optimised Essential System Service, AEMO must apply that price to
purchases of that Frequency Co-optimised Essential System Service in the
relevant Dispatch Interval; and

\(i\) where there is a shortfall in a Frequency Co-optimised Essential
System Service, AEMO must set the Market Clearing Price for that service
to the difference between the Energy Offer Price Ceiling and the Energy
Offer Price Floor.

7.11B. Determination of Market Clearing Prices

7.11B.1. Subject to section 7.11C, where AEMO runs the Dispatch
Algorithm, AEMO must determine a Market Clearing Price for each Market
Service for a Dispatch Interval.

7.11B.1A. If AEMO fails to run the Dispatch Algorithm to determine
Market Clearing Prices for any Dispatch Interval, then the Market
Clearing Prices for that Dispatch Interval are:

\(a\) if the Dispatch Interval has been included in a previous Dispatch
Schedule, the Market Clearing Prices determined for the Dispatch
Interval in the most recent Dispatch Schedule that includes the Dispatch
Interval; or

\(b\) if the Dispatch Interval has not been included in a previous
Dispatch Schedule, the Market Clearing Prices determined for the
Pre-Dispatch Interval containing the Dispatch Interval in the Reference
Scenario for the most recent Pre-Dispatch Schedule that includes the
Dispatch Interval.

7.11B.2. Subject to clauses 7.11B.3, 7.11B.4 and 7.11B.5, the Market
Clearing Price for a Market Service represents the marginal value of
that Market Service at the Reference Node at that time, which is
calculated as the cost of meeting an incremental change in the
requirement for the Market Service at that time in accordance with
clause 7.6.4.

7.11B.3. If, for any Dispatch Interval:

\(a\) the Market Clearing Prices for the Dispatch Interval have not

\(b\) AEMO reasonably determines that the Central Dispatch Process may
determine that there is insufficient capacity to meet all load; and

\(c\) AEMO has issued a manual load shed direction to a Network Operator
under clause 3.4.4,

then AEMO must set the Energy Market Clearing Price for the Dispatch
Interval to equal the Energy Offer Price Ceiling.

7.11B.3A. If, for any Dispatch Interval, the Energy Market Clearing
Price determined using the Dispatch Algorithm is:

\(a\) greater than the Energy Offer Price Ceiling, then AEMO must set
the Energy Market Clearing Price in that Dispatch Interval to equal the
Energy Offer Price Ceiling; and

\(b\) less than the Energy Offer Price Floor, then AEMO must set the
Energy Market Clearing Price in that Dispatch Interval to equal the
Energy Offer Price Floor.

7.11B.3B. If, for any Dispatch Interval, the Market Clearing Price for a
Frequency Co‑optimised Essential System Service determined using the
Dispatch Algorithm is:

\(a\) greater than the applicable FCESS Clearing Price Ceiling, then
AEMO must set the Market Clearing Price for the Frequency Co-optimised
Essential System Service in that Dispatch Interval to equal the
applicable FCESS Clearing Price Ceiling; and

\(b\) less than zero, then AEMO must set the Market Clearing Price for
the Frequency Co-optimised Essential System Service in that Dispatch
Interval to equal zero.

7.11B.4. If, for any Dispatch Interval, AEMO has determined that the
Dispatch Interval is an Affected Dispatch Interval under clause

7.11C. Corrections to Price Determinations and Intervention Pricing

7.11C.1. AEMO must develop procedures for the automatic identification
of Affected Dispatch Intervals, and must document in a WEM Procedure the
conditions or circumstances that would identify a Dispatch Interval as
an Affected Dispatch Interval.

7.11C.1A. AEMO must use the procedures developed under clause 7.11C.1 to
determine whether each Dispatch Interval is an Affected Dispatch
Interval.

7.11C.2. Where AEMO determines that a Dispatch Interval is an Affected
Dispatch Interval, and no more than 30 minutes have passed since the
publication of the Market Clearing Prices for the Affected Dispatch
Interval, AEMO must:

\(a\) replace all Market Clearing Prices with the corresponding prices
for the Last Correct Dispatch Interval; and

\(b\) if AEMO has already calculated the relevant Reference Trading
Price, recalculate and adjust the Reference Trading Price, in accordance
with clause 7.11A.1(b).

7.11C.3. As soon as reasonably practicable after the action referred in
clause 7.11C.2, AEMO must publish on the WEM Website a report outlining:

\(a\) the reasons for determining that a Dispatch Interval was an
Affected Dispatch Interval;

\(b\) whether that determination was correct; and

\(c\) what action will be taken to minimise the risk of a similar event
in future.

7.11C.4. At least once each year, AEMO must review the effectiveness of
the automated processes developed by AEMO under clause 7.11C.1 and
publish a report on the WEM Website detailing the findings of the
review.

7.11C.5. A report under clause 7.11C.4 must:

\(a\) cover the 12-month period since the end of the period covered by
the last report;

\(b\) be published within 3 months of the end of the review period
covered by the report; and

\(c\) include the following:

i\. details of all Affected Dispatch Intervals which should not have
been identified as Affected Dispatch Intervals;

ii\. the reasons why the Affected Dispatch Intervals identified under
clause 7.11C.5(c)(i) were identified as Affected Dispatch Intervals; and

iii\. details of any Dispatch Intervals that AEMO has subsequently
determined should have been identified by AEMO as Affected Dispatch
Intervals, but were not.

7.11C.5A.AEMO must develop and submit a Procedure Change Proposal where
it considers that a change is required to the WEM Procedure developed
under clause 7.11C.1 as a result of a report that it has published under
clause 7.11C.4.

<th><p><strong>Explanatory Note</strong></p>
<p>Clauses 7.11C.6 to 7.11C.11 set out a regime that is intended to
ensure that Market Clearing Prices are not depressed by reason of AEMO’s
manual intervention. For example, if AEMO directs a Registered Facility
on, then it will displace a cheaper Facility, and the marginal price of
the next unit of energy will be lower than it otherwise would have been
(i.e. because that cheaper generation is now available to provide the
marginal unit of energy).</p>
<p>This is a structural effect that is not dealt with by the uplift
payment mechanism, because even though the directed Market Participant
could be made whole via an uplift payment if negatively mispriced, all
other relevant Market Participants would receive a lower Market Clearing
Price because of the intervention.</p></th>

</tbody>
</table>

7.11C.6. AEMO must declare a Dispatch Interval to be an Intervention
Dispatch Interval where one or more AEMO Intervention Events were in
effect in the Dispatch Interval.

7.11C.7. Subject to clauses 7.11C.8(a) and 7.11C.8(b), if, in AEMO's
reasonable opinion, the reason for an AEMO Intervention Event is to
obtain either:

\(a\) a Market Service for which a Market Clearing Price is determined
by the Dispatch Algorithm; or

\(b\) a service that is a direct substitute for a Market Service for
which a Market Clearing Price is determined by the Dispatch Algorithm,

then AEMO must, in accordance with the methodology or assumptions to be
documented in the WEM Procedure referred to in clause 7.11C.11, set the
Market Clearing Prices for an Intervention Dispatch Interval at the
values which AEMO, in its reasonable opinion, considers would have
applied as the Market Clearing Prices for that Dispatch Interval had the
AEMO Intervention Event not occurred.

7.11C.8. If, in AEMO’s reasonable opinion, the reason for an AEMO
Intervention Event is to obtain:

\(a\) energy or a Frequency Co-optimised Essential System Service which,
as a result of a Constraint, is only capable of being provided by a
Registered Facility in a part of the SWIS which does not include the
Reference Node due to the Constraint;

\(b\) demand response which, as a result of a Constraint, is needed to
reduce demand for energy or Frequency Co-optimised Essential System
Service in a part of the SWIS which does not include the Reference Node
due to the Constraint; or

\(c\) a service for which a Market Clearing Price is not determined by
the Dispatch Algorithm, regardless of whether energy or Frequency
Co-optimised Essential System Services are also provided incidental to
the provision of the service,

then AEMO must continue to set the Market Clearing Prices for the
Intervention Dispatch Interval in accordance with section 7.11B,
excluding 7.11B.4A.

7.11C.9. If more than one AEMO Intervention Event is in effect in
respect of an Intervention Dispatch Interval, AEMO must set the Market
Clearing Prices pursuant to clause 7.11C.7 as if:

\(a\) the services described in clause 7.11C.7 were not provided; and

\(b\) energy or any Essential System Services provided incidental to the
provision of any services described in clause 7.11C.8 were taken into
account.

7.11C.10. AEMO must use its reasonable endeavours to set Market Clearing
Prices according to clause 7.11C.7 as soon as practicable following an
AEMO Intervention Event, but may continue to set Market Clearing Prices
as if no AEMO Intervention Event had occurred for Dispatch Intervals
before the later of:

\(a\) if AEMO is able to operate the SWIS in accordance with the Power
System Security Principles, the Dispatch Interval immediately following
the first Intervention Dispatch Interval; or

\(b\) if AEMO is not able to operate the SWIS in accordance with the
Power System Security Principles, the second Dispatch Interval after
AEMO became able to operate the SWIS in accordance with the Power System
Security Principles after the first Intervention Dispatch Interval.

7.11C.11. AEMO must document in a WEM Procedure the methodology it will
use, and any assumptions it may be required to make, to determine the
Market Clearing Prices under clauses 7.11C.7, 7.11C.8 and 7.11C.10. The
methodology must, wherever reasonably practicable:

\(a\) be consistent with the principles for the determination of Market
Clearing Prices set out in section 7.11A; and

\(b\) enable AEMO to determine and publish such prices in accordance
with the applicable timeframes for the publication of the Market
Clearing Prices under these WEM Rules.

7.11D. Real-Time Market Suspension

7.11D.1. AEMO may suspend the Real-Time Market:

\(a\) in the event of a system shutdown or major supply disruption;

\(b\) when AEMO has been requested by the Minister, under clause 2.44.1,
to suspend the market or operate all or part of the power system in
connection with the exercise of emergency powers; or

\(c\) when AEMO determines that it is necessary because it has become
impossible to maintain Power System Security in accordance with the

i\. failure of its IT systems;

ii\. loss of communications or control systems required to maintain
Power System Security; or

iii\. any other reason as identified in the WEM Procedure published
under clause 7.11D.4.

7.11D.2. Where AEMO deems, in its reasonable opinion, it is practicable
to resume the Central Dispatch Process it must:

\(a\) lift any suspension of the Real-Time Market at commencement of the
next practicable Trading Interval, in accordance with the process
described in the WEM Procedure referred to in clause 7.11D.4; and

\(b\) resume the determination of Market Clearing Prices.

7.11D.3. AEMO must issue a Market Advisory when suspending or lifting
the suspension of the Real-Time Market.

7.11D.4. AEMO must document in a WEM Procedure:

\(a\) the process by which AEMO will determine to suspend the Real-Time
Market;

\(b\) the reasons AEMO may suspend the Real-Time Market;

\(c\) the processes which Market Participants are required to follow

7.11E. Administered Pricing in the Event of Market System Failure

7.11E.1. If the Real-Time Market is suspended under clause 7.11D.1(a),
AEMO must set the final Market Clearing Prices for each Market Service
in any Dispatch Interval during the suspension as follows:

\(a\) the Final Energy Market Clearing Price is to equal the Energy
Offer Price Ceiling;

\(b\) the Final Regulation Raise Market Clearing Price is to equal zero
and the Essential System Service Enablement Quantity for each Registered
Facility accredited for Regulation Raise for the Dispatch Interval is
zero;

\(c\) the Final Regulation Lower Market Clearing Price is to equal zero
and the Essential System Service Enablement Quantity for each Registered
Facility accredited for Regulation Lower for the Dispatch Interval is
zero;

\(d\) the Final Contingency Reserve Raise Market Clearing Price is to
equal zero and the Essential System Service Enablement Quantity for each
Registered Facility accredited for Contingency Reserve Raise for the
Dispatch Interval is zero;

\(e\) the Final Contingency Reserve Lower Market Clearing Price is to
equal zero and the Essential System Service Enablement Quantity for each
Registered Facility accredited for Contingency Reserve Lower for the
Dispatch Interval is zero; and

\(f\) the Final RoCoF Control Service Market Clearing Price is to equal
zero and the RoCoF Control Service requirements for the Dispatch
Interval is zero.

7.11E.2. If the Real-Time Market is suspended under clause 7.11D.1(b),
AEMO must set the final Market Clearing Prices for each Market Service
in any Dispatch Interval during the suspension as requested by the
Minister.

7.11E.3. If the Real-Time Market is suspended under clause 7.11D.1(c),
AEMO must set the final Market Clearing Prices for each Market Service
in any Dispatch Interval during the suspension as the average final
Market Clearing Price for that Market Service in the equivalent
intervals in the four most recent completed Trading Weeks.

7.11E.4. Where, for the purposes of clause 7.11E.3, a Market Clearing
Price is not available for a Market Service for an equivalent Dispatch
Interval in the four most recent completed Trading Weeks referred to in
clause 7.11E.3, AEMO must set the final Market Clearing Prices for each
Market Service as follows:

\(a\) where there is no Final Energy Market Clearing Price available for
the equivalent Dispatch Interval, AEMO must set the Final Energy Market
Clearing Price as the average price for energy from the most recently
published price for energy for 28 consecutive Trading Days for the
equivalent Dispatch Interval;

\(b\) where there is no Final Regulation Raise Market Clearing Price
available for the equivalent Dispatch Interval, AEMO must set the Final
Regulation Raise Market Clearing Price as the average price for
Regulation Raise, or equivalent service, from the most recently
published price for the service for 28 consecutive Trading Days for the
equivalent Dispatch Interval;

\(c\) where there is no Final Regulation Lower Market Clearing Price
available for the equivalent Dispatch Interval, AEMO must set the Final
Regulation Lower Market Clearing Price as the average price for
Regulation Lower, or equivalent service, from the most recently
published price for the service for 28 consecutive Trading Days for the
equivalent Dispatch Interval;

\(d\) where there is no Final Contingency Reserve Raise Market Clearing
Price available for the equivalent Dispatch Interval, AEMO must set the
Final Contingency Reserve Raise Market Clearing Price as:

Margin(di) × Energy\_Price(di)

where:

i\. Margin is the Spinning Reserve margin price as the most recent
determination by the Economic Regulation Authority for the equivalent
Dispatch Interval; and

ii\. Energy\_Price is the average price for energy from the most
recently published energy prices for 28 consecutive Trading Days for the
equivalent Dispatch Interval;

\(e\) where there is no Final Contingency Reserve Lower Market Clearing
Price available for the equivalent Dispatch Interval, AEMO must set the
Final Contingency Reserve Lower Price Market Clearing Price using an
estimation method that takes into account the quantum and price set by
the Economic Regulation Authority for load rejection reserve; and

\(f\) where there is no Final RoCoF Control Service Market Clearing
Price available for the equivalent Dispatch Interval, AEMO must set the
RoCoF Control Service requirements for the Dispatch Interval to zero and
set the Final RoCoF Control Service Market Clearing Price to zero.

7.11E.5. All administered prices set under clauses 7.11E.3 and 7.11E.4
will be subject to a floor of $0.

7.11E.6. To avoid doubt, and without limiting clause 1.55.9, for the
purposes of the time periods specified in clauses 7.11E.3 and 7.11E.4,
AEMO may, to the extent it considers necessary to set the final Market
Clearing Prices specified in those clauses, use any data and information
under the Pre-Amended Rules (as defined in clause 1.55.9) that it
considers reasonable to use in the circumstances.

<th><p><strong>Explanatory Note</strong></p>
<p>Chapter 9 has been restructured for ease of reading and to reflect
that there are substantial changes to settlement calculations, including
due to the new ESS framework and causer pays approach to cost
recovery.</p>
<p>In addition, the former STEM and NSTEM settlement timelines have been
merged into a single settlement timeline, including with a single
settlement statement, to decrease administrative burden.</p>
<p>Complex calculations for the following have been included in
appendices:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>calculation of the runway share for Contingency Reserve Raise
cost recovery and Additional RoCoF Control Requirement component of
RoCoF Control Service cost recovery (Appendix 2A);</p></li>
<li><p>calculation of the Minimum RoCoF Control Requirement component of
the RoCoF Control Service cost recovery (Appendix 2B); and</p></li>
<li><p>calculation of SESSM refunds (Appendix 2C).</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Clauses 9.1.2(g)(ii) and 9.13.1 are also amended by the Governance
Amendments that commence on 1 July 2021 to introduce "Coordinator Fees"
and "Coordinator Fee rate", as applicable. However, as Chapter 9 is
deleted and replaced by the Tranches 2 and 3 Amendments, Chapter 9 only
shows the Tranches 2 and 3 Amendments as they are the amending rules
affecting this section (made by the Minister at the date this companion
version was prepared) that will be commenced last. Please refer to the
Governance Amendments to see the changes to Clauses 9.1.2(g)(ii) and
9.13.1 that will commence on 1 July 2021.</p>
<p>Various clauses in Chapter 9 are also amended by the October 2021 RCM
Pricing Amendments, including as a result of tranche based dispatch
payments for DSPs ceasing from the 2019 Reserve Capacity Cycle (i.e.
from the 2021 Capacity Year), the Tranche 1 Amendments and the
Miscellaneous Amendments No. 1. As Chapter 9 is deleted to reflect the
amendments contained in the Tranches 2 and 3 Amendments, as those
amending rules (made by the Minister at the date this companion version
was prepared) will be commenced last, please refer to the October 2021
RCM Pricing Amendments, Tranche 1 Amendments and Miscellaneous
Amendments No. 1 to see the changes to Chapter 9 that will either apply

9\. Settlement

Introduction

<tr class="header">
<th><p><strong>Explanatory Note</strong></p>
<p>Clause 9.1.1 is added to reflect that the Network Operator is a party
to settlement for RoCoF cost recovery and therefore the term Market
Participant is not appropriate in that case. 9.1.1 removes AEMO from the
definition of Rule Participant for Chapter 9 so AEMO is not
inadvertently captured in settlement equations.</p></th>

<tbody>
</tbody>
</table>

9.1.1. In this Chapter 9, apart from clause 9.1.3 (where Rule
Participant has its ordinary meaning), a reference to "Rule Participant"
is a reference to the relevant Market Participant or the relevant
Network Operator as the case may be (and is not a reference to any other
Rule Participant).

9.1.2. Settlement is to be based on whole Trading Days, though partial
Trading Days are to be facilitated on the first and last day of a
financial year and at the commencement of the market. For this purpose,
AEMO may declare that part of a Trading Day is to be treated as if that
part was a full Trading Day by notice published on the WEM Website.

Coordinator Fees are treated in the same way as Market Participant
Regulator Fees for the purposes of GST.</p></th>

9.1.3. With respect to the treatment of GST:

\(a\) all prices, fees and other charges under these WEM Rules (other
than under this clause 9.1.3) are exclusive of GST;

\(b\) in this clause 9.1.3, “adjustment notes”, “GST group”, “input tax
credit”, “member”, “recipient created tax invoice”, “representative
member”, “supply”, “tax invoice”, “taxable supply” and “valid tax
invoice” each have the meaning given to the relevant term in the GST
Act;

\(c\) where a Rule Participant makes a taxable supply to another Rule
Participant or person under these WEM Rules, the other Rule Participant
or person must also pay the first Rule Participant making the supply an
additional amount equal to the GST payable in respect of that supply;

\(d\) AEMO must include in Settlement Statements and Invoices issued
under these WEM Rules the additional amounts contemplated by clause
9.1.3(c);

\(e\) Rule Participants must, if requested by AEMO, do everything
necessary (including entering into recipient created tax invoice
agreements) to enable AEMO to issue valid tax invoices, recipient
created tax invoices and adjustment notes in respect of all taxable
supplies made by or to AEMO under these WEM Rules;

\(f\) however, if the additional amount paid or payable to AEMO or a
Rule Participant or another person under this clause 9.1.3 in respect of
a taxable supply differs from the actual amount of GST payable by the
Rule Participant under the GST Act in respect of the relevant supply,
then adjustments must be made under clause 9.15 so as to ensure the
additional amount paid under this clause in respect of the supply is
equal to the actual amount of GST payable under the GST Act in respect
of the supply; and

\(g\) if AEMO determines that:

i\. a party is entitled to payment of any costs or expenses by way of
reimbursement or indemnity; or

ii\. a price, fee or other charge payable under these WEM Rules (other
than Market Participant Regulator Fees and Market Participant
Coordinator Fees) is calculated with reference to a cost or expense
incurred by a party,

then the payment or cost or expense (as the case may be) must exclude
any part of the cost or expense which is attributable to GST for which
the party (or a representative member of any GST group of which the
party is a member) is entitled to an input tax credit.

9.1.4. Where these WEM Rules indicate interest is payable on an amount,
interest accrues daily at the Bank Bill Rate from (and including) the
date that payment was due up to (but excluding) the date of payment, or
in the case of an adjusted Settlement Statement provided under clause
9.15 from (and including) the payment due date for the Invoice issued
for the original Settlement Statement up to (but excluding) the actual
date of payment for the Invoice issued for the adjusted Settlement
Statement.

9.1.5. Except where otherwise stated, AEMO will perform all calculations
described in this chapter.

\(c\) Non-Scheduled Facility; and

\(d\) Non-Dispatchable Load.

9.5.2. Subject to clauses 2.30B.10 and 2.30B.11, the Metered Schedule
for a Trading Interval for each:

\(a\) Scheduled Facility;

\(b\) Semi-Scheduled Facility;

\(c\) Non-Scheduled Facility; and

\(d\) Non-Dispatchable Load, excluding Non-Dispatchable Loads referred

Submissions received by AEMO in accordance with section 8.4 or SCADA
data maintained by AEMO in accordance with clause 7.13.1E(a)(i) where
interval meter data is not available.

9.5.3. AEMO must determine a single Metered Schedule for a Trading
Interval for those Non-Dispatchable Loads without interval meters or
with meters not read as interval meters that are served by Synergy
where:

\(a\) the Metered Schedule equals the Notional Wholesale Meter value for
that Trading Interval;

\(b\) the Notional Wholesale Meter value for a Trading Interval equals
negative one multiplied by:

i\. the sum of the Metered Schedules with positive quantities for that
Trading Interval; plus

ii\. the sum of the Metered Schedules with negative quantities for that

9.15. Adjustment Process

9.15.1. When undertaking an Adjustment Process AEMO must:

\(a\) recalculate the amounts included in the Relevant Settlement
Statements in accordance with this Chapter 9 but taking into account
any:

i\. revised meter data which has been provided by Metering Data Agents;

ii\. actions arising from a Notice of Disagreement;

iii\. resolution of a Notice of Dispute;

iv\. revised Market Participant Market Fee rate or Market Participant
Regulator Fee rate;

v\. adjustment required for GST purposes under clause 9.1.3;

vi\. revised value that AEMO reasonably considers to be in compliance
with these WEM Rules and accurate; and

vii\. other relevant value that has been revised in accordance with the
WEM Rules; and

\(b\) provide adjusted Settlement Statements to Rule Participants for
Relevant Settlement Statements on the Relevant Settlement Adjustment
Date.

9.15.2. Where AEMO decides that it will use a revised value, as
contemplated under clause 9.15.1(a)(vi), in the final adjusted
Settlement Statement (to be issued on Settlement Adjustment Date 3 for a
Trading Week), AEMO must, as soon as practicable, notify the relevant
Rule Participant of the proposed revised value and the reason for its
decision.

9.15.3. Subject to clause 9.15.4, an adjusted Settlement Statement must
be in the same form as the original Settlement Statement, but where data
is modified between the issuance of the original Settlement Statement
and the adjusted Settlement Statement, AEMO must record adjusted
settlement values in the adjusted Settlement Statement and provide an
explanation of any changes on request.

9.15.4. An adjusted Settlement Statement must include details of the
adjustment to be paid by or to the Rule Participant, being:

\(a\) the adjustment which will need to be paid by or to the Rule
Participant to put the Rule Participant in the position it would have
been in at the time payment was made in respect of the original
Settlement Statement if the adjusted Settlement Statement had been
issued as the original Settlement Statement (but taking into account any
adjustments previously made under this section 9.15); plus

\(b\) interest on the amount referred to in clause 9.15.4(a) calculated
in accordance with clause 9.1.4.

9.15.5. In recalculating amounts as part of an Adjustment Process, AEMO
may use the version of the settlement calculation software current at
the time of the recalculation.

9.15.6. At the same time as AEMO provides a Rule Participant with an
adjusted Settlement Statement under clause 9.15.1(b), it must also
provide that Rule Participant with an Invoice reflecting the adjusted
Settlement Statement and the amounts referred to in clause 9.15.4.

9.15.7. The Settlement Date for a Settlement Statement issued under
clause 9.15.1(b) is the date upon which transactions covered by that
Settlement Statement are settled and must be no later than the second
Business Day following the date of issue of the Invoice described in
clause 9.15.6.

9.15.8. If, for an Adjustment Process, the Service Fee Settlement Amount
payable to AEMO under clause 9.13.2 based on the adjusted Market
Participant Market Fees settlement amount is less than the Service Fee
Settlement Amount payable to AEMO under clause 9.13.2 for the last
Settlement Statement for that period, AEMO must make available the
shortfall amount from the fund established under clause 9.18.9 for the
purpose of meeting AEMO’s obligations under clause 9.18.8.

9.15.9. AEMO and the Economic Regulation Authority must agree and
implement an arrangement to apply for any Adjustment Process where the
Service Fee Settlement Amount payable to the Economic Regulation
Authority under clause 9.13.3 based on the adjusted Market Participant
Regulator Fees settlement amount is less than the Service Fee Settlement
Amount payable to the Economic Regulation Authority under clause 9.13.3
for the last Settlement Statement for that period. The arrangement must
require:

\(a\) the Economic Regulation Authority to return the shortfall amount
to AEMO by 10:00 AM on the relevant Settlement Date; and

\(b\) AEMO, if the Economic Regulation Authority fails to provide the
shortfall amount to AEMO by 10:00 AM on the relevant Settlement Date, to
make available the shortfall amount from the fund established under
clause 9.18.9 for the purpose of meeting AEMO’s obligations under clause
9.18.8.

9.15.10. AEMO and the Coordinator must agree and implement an
arrangement to apply for any Adjustment Process where the Service Fee
Settlement Amount payable to the Coordinator under clause 9.13.4 based
on the adjusted Market Participant Coordinator Fees settlement amount is
less than the Service Fee Settlement Amount payable to the Coordinator
under clause 9.13.4 for the last Settlement Statement for that period.
The arrangement must require:

\(a\) the Coordinator to return the shortfall amount to AEMO by 10:00 AM
on the relevant Settlement Date; and

\(b\) AEMO, if the Coordinator fails to provide the shortfall amount to
AEMO by 10:00 AM on the relevant Settlement Date, to make available the
shortfall amount from the fund established under clause 9.18.9 for the
purpose of meeting AEMO’s obligations under clause 9.18.8.

with these WEM Rules and accurate; or

\(b\) if the information relates to values that are outputs to the
settlement process AEMO must review its settlement calculations and
assess whether any errors were made.

9.16.9. AEMO must, as soon as practicable, but within 20 Business Days

Network Operators (as applicable), and the reasons provided to AEMO for

9.20.2. If, under Part 5.7B of the Corporations Act or another law
relating to insolvency or the protection of creditors or similar
matters, AEMO is required to disgorge or repay an amount, or pay an
amount equivalent to an amount, paid by a Rule Participant under the WEM
Rules:

\(a\) AEMO may Draw Upon any Credit Support held by AEMO in relation to
the Rule Participant for the amount disgorged, repaid or paid (“**Repaid
Amount**”); and

\(b\) If AEMO is not able to recover all or part of the Repaid Amount by
drawing upon Credit Support held by AEMO in relation to the Rule
Participant, then AEMO must raise a Repaid Amount Levy from all Market
Participants (other than from Market Participants with unrecovered
Payment Defaults) to recover the remainder of the Repaid Amount. AEMO
will determine the amount to be paid by each Market Participant, having
regard to the absolute value of the MWh of generation or consumption,
determined in accordance with the Metered Schedules, for each Market
Participant for Trading Intervals during the most recent Trading Week
for which Settlement Statements have been issued, as a proportion of the
total of those values for all Market Participants (other than Market
Participants with unrecovered Payment Defaults).

9.20.2A. AEMO must notify each relevant Market Participant of the amount
it must pay in respect of the Repaid Amount Levy as determined in
accordance with clause 9.20.2(b) within six Business Days of AEMO being
notified of the requirement to provide the Repaid Amount under clause
9.20.2.

9.20.2B. A Market Participant must pay the full amount notified by AEMO
under clause 9.20.2A to AEMO (in cleared funds) by 10:00 AM on the
eighth Business Day after the date of AEMO's notification under clause
9.20.2A, whether or not the Market Participant disputes the amount
required to be paid.

9.20.2C. By the end of the second month following the end of a Financial
Year, AEMO must re-allocate any Repaid Amount Levies raised during that
Financial Year as follows:

\(a\) AEMO will determine the sum of the Repaid Amount Levies raised by
AEMO during the Financial Year;

\(b\) AEMO will determine the aggregate Repaid Amount Levy amount which
should have been paid by each Market Participant, having regard to the
absolute value of the MWh of generation or consumption, as determined in
accordance with the Metered Schedules for each Market Participant
(excluding Market Participants with unrecovered Payment Defaults) for
Trading Intervals during the Financial Year as a proportion of the total
of those values for all these Market Participants;

\(c\) AEMO must compare the amount determined for the Market Participant
under clause 9.20.2C(b) with the total of the amounts the Market
Participant has paid to AEMO under clause 9.20.2B;

\(d\) AEMO must determine an appropriate adjustment to put each Market
Participant in the position it would have been in had it paid the amount
determined under clause 9.20.2C(b) instead of the amounts actually paid
under clause 9.20.2B; and

\(e\) AEMO must include that adjustment in the Settlement Statement for
the most recently completed Trading Week.

9.20.4. AEMO must apply the Total Amount as follows.

\(a\) First, AEMO must apply the Total Amount to satisfy:

i\. payment of Service Fee Settlement Amounts to AEMO, the Economic
Regulation Authority and the Coordinator (including as contemplated by
clause 9.18.10); and

ii\. payments which AEMO is required to make under Supplementary
Capacity Contracts or to a provider of a System Restart Contract with
AEMO, up to a maximum for any party of the net amount which, if
sufficient funds were available, would be payable to that party,

but if the Total Amount is not sufficient to satisfy all of these
payments then AEMO must reduce the payments proportionally. Each payment
will be based on the proportion that the Total Amount bears to the
amount that would have been required to make all payments.

\(b\) Second, AEMO must apply the remainder to pay the net amounts
(after the application of clause 9.20.4(a)) which, if sufficient funds
were available, it would owe to Rule Participants in accordance with
clause 9.18, where those amounts are reduced by applying the following
formula:

> AAP = (NAP / TNAP) × MAA
>
> where:

i\. AAP is the reduced amount actually payable by AEMO to a Rule
Participant in respect of the relevant Trading Week;

ii\. NAP is the net amount that would have been payable by AEMO to the
Rule Participant (after the application of clause 9.20.4(a)) but for the
application of this clause 9.20.4(b), in respect of the relevant Trading
Week;

iii\. TNAP is the total net amount payable by AEMO to all Rule
Participants (after the application of clause 9.20.4(a)) but for the
application of this clause 9.20.4(b), in respect of the relevant Trading
Week, calculated by summing all values of NAP; and

iv\. MAA is the remainder of the Total Amount available for payment by
AEMO after the application of clause 9.20.4(a).

9.20.5. If AEMO has reduced any payment under clause 9.20.4 as a result
of a Payment Default and, within five Business Days of the Payment
Default, it has received full or partial payment of the overdue amount,
then AEMO must within one Business Day apply the amount received
(including any interest paid under clause 9.18.7 in respect of the
Payment Default) as follows.

\(a\) First, AEMO must apply the amount received to pay parties who
suffered a reduction under clause 9.20.4(a). The amount payable by AEMO
to each party is equal to the amount by which that party’s payment was
originally reduced under clause 9.20.4(a), adjusted to reflect interest
accrued in accordance with clause 9.1.3 and any payments already made
under this clause 9.20.5. However, if the amount received by AEMO is
less than the total amount payable to these parties then AEMO must
reduce the payments proportionally. Each payment will be based on the
proportion that the amount received by AEMO bears to the total amount
payable under this clause 9.20.5(a).

\(b\) Second, AEMO must apply the remainder on a pro-rata basis to all
Rule Participants who suffered a reduction under clause 9.20.4(b). The
amount to be paid to each relevant Rule Participant is determined by
applying the formula in clause 9.20.4(b), but as if:

i\. AAP referred to the amount to be paid to each relevant Rule
Participant;

ii\. MAA referred to the remainder of the full or partial payment after
the application of clause 9.20.5(a); and

iii\. NAP and TNAP have the same values as when the reduction was
calculated.

9.20.6. If, five Business Days after a Payment Default, AEMO is yet to
recover in full the overdue amount, then it must raise a Default Levy
from all Market Participants (other than from Market Participants with
unrecovered Payment Defaults) to cover the remaining shortfall
(including interest calculated in accordance with clause 9.18.7). AEMO
will determine the amount to be paid by each Market Participant, having
regard to the absolute value of the MWh of generation or consumption,
determined in accordance with the Metered Schedules, for each Market
Participant for Trading Intervals during the most recent Trading Week
for which Settlement Statements have been issued, as a proportion of the
total of those values for all Market Participants (other than Market
Participants with unrecovered Payment Defaults).

9.20.7. AEMO must notify each relevant Market Participant of the amount
it must pay in respect of the Default Levy as determined in accordance
with clause 9.20.6 within six Business Days of the Payment Default
occurring.

9.20.8. A Market Participant must pay the full amount notified by AEMO
under clause 9.20.7 to AEMO (in cleared funds) by 10:00 AM of the eighth
Business Day following the date of the Payment Default, whether or not
it disputes the amount notified.

9.20.9. By 2:00 PM on the eighth Business Day following the date of a
Payment Default, AEMO is to allocate the total of the Default Levy
amounts received under clause 9.20.8 as follows.

\(a\) First, AEMO must apply the total amount received to pay parties
who suffered a reduction under clause 9.20.4(a). The amount payable by
AEMO to each party is equal to the amount by which that party’s payment
was originally reduced under clause 9.20.4(a), adjusted to reflect
interest accrued in accordance with clause 9.1.4 and any payments
already made under clause 9.20.5 or this clause 9.20.9. However, if the
amount received by AEMO is less than the total amount payable to these
parties then AEMO must reduce the payments proportionally. Each payment
will be based on the proportion that the total amount received by AEMO
bears to the total amount that would have been required to make all
payments under this clause 9.20.9(a).

\(b\) Second, AEMO must apply the remainder on a pro-rata basis to all
Rule Participants who suffered a reduction under clause 9.20.4(b). The
amount to be paid to each relevant Rule Participant is determined by
applying the formula in clause 9.20.4(b), but as if:

i\. AAP referred to the amount to be paid to each relevant Rule
Participant;

ii\. MAA referred to the remainder of the total of the Default Levy
amounts received under clause 9.20.8 after the application of clause
9.20.9(a); and

iii\. NAP and TNAP have the same values as when the reduction was
calculated.

which it raised Default Levies during the Financial Year less any
subsequent amounts recovered and refunded under clause 9.20.12;

\(b\) AEMO will determine the aggregate Default Levy amount which should
have been paid by each Market Participant, having regard to the absolute
value of the MWh of generation or consumption, as determined in
accordance with the Metered Schedules for each Market Participant
(excluding Market Participants with unrecovered Payment Defaults) for
Trading Intervals during the Financial Year as a proportion of the total
of those values for all these Market Participants;

\(c\) AEMO must compare the amount determined for the Market Participant
under clause 9.20.11(b) with the total of the amounts which the Market
Participant actually paid under clause 9.20.8;

determined under clause 9.20.11(b) instead of the amounts actually paid
under clause 9.20.8; and

\(e\) AEMO must include that adjustment in the Settlement Statement for
the most recently completed Trading Week.

9.20.12. If, after raising a Default Levy in respect of a Payment
Default in accordance with clause 9.20.6, AEMO recovers all or part of
the relevant shortfall from the defaulting Rule Participant, then it
must use the amount recovered to refund Default Levy amounts paid under
clause 9.20.8 in respect of the Payment Default as soon as practicable
but not later than the end of the calendar month following the month in
which the amount is recovered. AEMO will determine the amount to be
refunded to each Market Participant which paid a Default Levy amount
under clause 9.20.8 in respect of the Payment Default (as adjusted, if
applicable, under clause 9.20.11). In determining the amount to be
refunded to a Market Participant, AEMO must have regard to:

\(a\) the amount recovered; and

\(b\) the Default Levy amount paid by the Market Participant under
clause 9.20.8 (as adjusted, if applicable, under clause 9.20.11) as a
proportion of the total of those amounts paid by all Market

<p>Under the revised Market Information framework, neither AEMO nor the
Coordinator will be required to create and maintain a list outlining the
confidentiality status of each type of Market Information. Rather, the
WEM Rules will contain a list of principles that will guide the
classification of Market Information (that is, information required to
be produced, collected or exchanged under the WEM Rules or WEM
Procedures). The WEM Rules will continue to set out which type of
information must be published, and in limited circumstances may specify
that information is public or confidential.</p>
<p>There will only be two categories of Market Information, Public
Information and Confidential Information, and the classes under clause
10.2.2 are reduced to reflect this. Instead section 10.4 sets out how
Confidential Information may be disclosed.</p>
<p>It will be the responsibility of the Information Manager (in the
first instance) to determine the status of information. The Information
Manager can only be the Coordinator, the ERA, AEMO or a Network
Operator, and within this framework will either be the party that
collects or the party that produces the Market Information. That party
to whom the Market Information relates (known as the Information
Stakeholder) will be able to provide their view to the Information
Manager to inform the assessment of confidentiality, however it will be
solely up to the Information Manager to make this decision</p>
<p>The Coordinator will be available to resolve any disputes about
confidentiality or to provide advice to the Information Manager if
requested. The WEM Rules will allow for the Coordinator to publish a
procedure with information about assessing confidentiality, as this may
be desirable to improve transparency and consistency in decision making
across different Information Managers.</p>
<p>The intent of the drafting is that the same ‘type’ of information,
(i.e. information submitted under a certain section, clause or
sub-clause of the WEM Rules) maintains the same confidentiality status
over time. It seeks to avoid a type of Market Information being treated
as Confidential Information as it relates to one Rule Participant, but
Public Information as it relates to another Rule Participant, or
differently over time.</p></th>

10.2.1. Subject to clause 10.2.1B, an Information Manager must, in
accordance with the WEM Rules and WEM Procedures, determine the
confidentiality status for each type of Market Information it is
responsible for under clause 10.2.12.

10.2.1A. No confidentiality status will be given to information,
documents or data disclosed to the Coordinator, the Economic Regulation
Authority, AEMO or a Network Operator if that information, documents or
data is not Market Information.

10.2.1B. An Information Manager is not required to determine the
confidentiality status of a type of Market Information for which it is
responsible if the Information Manager:

\(a\) has not been requested to disclose the type of Market Information
to any requesting party under section 10.4;

\(b\) is not required to disclose the type of Market Information to any
other party under these WEM Rules or a WEM Procedure; and

\(c\) treats the type of Market Information as Confidential Information
for the purposes of clauses 10.2.9 and 10.4.2.

10.2.2. The classes of confidentiality status are:

\(a\) Public Information, in which case the Market Information may be
made available to any person by any person; and

\(b\) Confidential Information, in which case the Market Information may
only be disclosed in accordance with clauses 10.4.4 and 10.4.19, or as
otherwise required under these WEM Rules and the WEM Procedures.

10.2.3. Subject to clause 10.2.5, an Information Manager must classify
Market Information as Confidential Information if:

\(a\) the Information Manager is not required to classify the Market
Information as Public Information under clause 10.2.4; and

\(b\) the Market Information:

i\. is contained in a contract to which the Rule Participant is a
counterparty, but only insofar as the Market Information is specified in
the contract as being confidential under the contract;

ii\. could, in the reasonable opinion of the Information Manager, pose a
material risk to Power System Security or Power System Reliability if
disclosed;

iii\. reveals personal details about an individual, but excluding their
name and business contact details (including company name and address
details, position, telephone numbers, mobile numbers and email
addresses) that forms part of Market Information that is not
confidential;

iv\. could, in the reasonable opinion of the Information Manager (or
Coordinator in the case of a dispute under section 10.5), cause
commercial detriment to a Rule Participant or another person if
disclosed; or

v\. is otherwise specified as Confidential Information under these WEM
Rules.

10.2.4. Market Information must be classified as Public Information if
it is:

\(a\) specified as Public Information under these WEM Rules;

\(b\) required to be published or otherwise made publicly available
under these WEM Rules; or

\(c\) available in the public domain, other than by reason of a breach
of these WEM Rules or by any other unlawful means.

10.2.5. Clause 10.2.3 does not prevent the disclosure or publication of
Market Information if it is aggregated, arranged or combined with other
data or information such that it does not reveal any Confidential
Information. Market Information that is aggregated, arranged or combined
with other data or information such that it does not reveal any
Confidential Information is deemed to be Market Information that is
classified as Public Information.

10.2.6. Without limiting clause 10.2.4, an Information Manager must
classify Market Information as Public Information if the Information
Manager does not consider that the Market Information is required to be
classified as Confidential Information under clause 10.2.3.

10.2.7. A Rule Participant may make a submission to an Information
Manager about Market Information that the Rule Participant considers to
be Confidential Information if:

\(a\) the Rule Participant is an Information Stakeholder for the Market
Information; and

\(b\) the confidentiality status of the Market Information is not
required to be Public Information under clause 10.2.4.

A submission must include the Rule Participant’s reasoning for
classifying the Market Information as Confidential Information against
the criteria in clause 10.2.3.

10.2.7A. A Rule Participant is an Information Stakeholder for Market
Information if:

\(a\) the Market Information explicitly relates to the Rule Participant
or its Facilities, activities or contractual arrangements;

\(b\) where clause 10.2.7A(a) does not apply, the Rule Participant or
its Facilities, activities or contractual arrangements would otherwise
be able to be identified from the Market Information; or

\(c\) the Market Information relates to information, data or documents
that a third party provided to the Rule Participant and the Rule
Participant is under a duty or obligation (however described) to that
third party to keep the relevant information, data or documents
confidential.

10.2.8. A submission from a Rule Participant made under clause 10.2.7
must be considered by the Information Manager (or the Coordinator in the
case of a dispute under section 10.5) when classifying Market
Information. However the Information Manager (or Coordinator in the case
of a dispute under section 10.5) will not be bound by any submission
made by a Rule Participant in making its determination.

10.2.9. Subject to clauses 10.4.4 and 10.4.19, and unless otherwise
required or permitted by these WEM Rules, the Coordinator, the Economic
Regulation Authority and Rule Participants must not disclose
Confidential Information to any person.

10.2.10. The Coordinator may document in a WEM Procedure guidance for
Information Managers to assist with determining the confidentiality
status of Market Information in accordance with clause 10.2.3.

<p>New definition for ‘Not In-Service Capacity’ is used in clause

<p>Currently a Market Participant must submit in its Balancing
Submissions prices and quantities at which it is willing to dispatch its
Facilities. If plant is unavailable this must be declared and be
accompanied by either a planned or forced outage declaration. As a
result there will be direct financial consequences for the Market
Participant in the RCM. All plant which is declared “available” would be
subject to receiving a dispatch instruction if it is in merit. Again,
there will be consequences for the Market Participant if it is unable to
respond to a Dispatch Instruction.</p>
<p>However, under the new changes to the availability declarations, a
declaration “Available but not in service” could allow a Market
Participant to avoid being dispatched while still declaring it is
available in its real time market submissions. Even if it is in merit it
will not be issued a dispatch instructions unless it changes its status
to in service.</p>
<p>To replicate the current treatment of Market Participants in like

<p>The definition of Small Aggregation as a Facility Technology Type
will be reviewed holistically with both the policy intent for facility
aggregation (at both transmission and distribution level) as well as how
DER is to participate in the WEM in the future. However, for the
purposes of the RCM, the definition of Small Aggregation as set out
below suffices to enable distributed energy resources to aggregate
behind the same TNI and participate in the RCM. These small aggregations
are expected to be registered as Non-Scheduled Facilities.</p>
<p>The definition of System Size considers contracted access to the
market which estimates the impact of a facility on the market. This
definition also explicitly references the charge and discharge
capability of Electric Storage Resources and this avoids the need to
specify single cycle changes. System Size is used in sections 2.28 and
2.29 of the Tranches 2 and 3 Amendments in the context of energy
producing systems at unregistered facilities and therefore the
definition has changed Facility to facility to account for both
registered and unregistered facilities. The definition of System Size
uses the term energy producing equipment instead of energy producing
system to denote the fact that the system comprises the entirety of all
generating and storage equipment at the facility.</p></th>

<p>This runway calculation does not include Intermittent Loads.
Intermittent Loads will be added to the runway calculation in a future
tranche of Amending Rules once the registration framework is
finalised.</p>
<p>1.1 This Appendix 2A sets out the steps that are to be followed by
AEMO in determining <em>TotalRunwayShare(p,DI)</em>, being the
allocation share of Market Participant p in Dispatch Interval DI for the
costs of procuring:</p>
<p>(a) Contingency Reserve Raise (see clause 9.10.30); and</p>
<p>(b) Additional RoCoF Control Requirement component of RoCoF Control
Service (see clause 9.10.34)</p>
<p>by use of a "modified runway allocation method" for each Dispatch
Interval allocating the share of the costs above to Market Participants
based on their Facility Risk (see Glossary) in the Dispatch
Interval.</p>
<p>1.2 The cost of procuring Contingency Reserve Raise and Additional
RoCoF Control Requirement component of RoCoF Control Service (jointly
referred to as the relevant Essential System Service) is allocated to
Registered Facilities with a Facility Risk greater than 10MW (see Clause
2.3 of this Appendix 2A).</p>
<p>1.3 The cost of procuring the relevant Essential System Service is
split into two components (see clause 5.1 of this Appendix 2A):</p>
<p>(a) A Network Component - this is calculated in clause 5.1(a) of this
Appendix 2A:</p>
<p>(i) This component is zero if the Largest Credible Supply Contingency
is not set by a Network Contingency. It is also zero if the Largest
Network Risk equals the Largest Facility Risk (i.e. a Facility
Contingency and Network Contingency are tied as the Largest Credible
Supply Contingency).</p>
<p>(ii) This component is non-zero if the Largest Credible Supply
Contingency is set by a Network Contingency and is not set by a Facility
Contingency as the Largest Credible Supply Contingency. In this case,
the share Network Component is calculated as the ratio of</p>
<p>(A) the difference between the Largest Network Risk and the Largest
Facility Risk; and</p>
<p>(B) the Largest Network Risk.</p>
<p>(iii) This ensures that causers of Network Contingencies only
pay:</p>
<p>(A) when their Network Contingency sets the Contingency Reserve Raise
Requirement;</p>
<p>(B) a delta - in that their cost allocation is based on the
additional relevant Essential System Service procured as a result of
their Network Contingency setting the Contingency Reserve Raise
Requirement.</p>
<p><em>For example, if Largest Network Risk = 300 (set by region A) and
Largest Facility Risk = 240 (set by generator X), then the causers of
the Region A Network Contingency would pay (300-240)/300 = 20% of the
relevant Essential System Service costs in a given Dispatch
Interval.</em></p>
<p>(iv) If two or more Network Contingencies set the Largest Credible
Supply contingency, then each tied Network Contingency is allocated an
equal share of the Network Component.</p>
<p><em>For example, if two Network Contingencies were tied with Largest
Network Risk = 300 (set by region A and region B) in the example above,
then the causers of the each Network Contingency would pay 20%/2 = 10%
of the relevant Essential System Service costs in a given Dispatch
Interval.</em></p>
<p>(b) A Facility Component (see clause 5.1(b) of this Appendix 2A)
which equals one minus the Network Component calculated above. This
component equals 100% if a Facility Contingency sets the Largest
Credible Supply Contingency.</p>
<p>1.4 Appendix 2A calculates runway shares for Registered Facilities
separately for:</p>
<p>(a) Facilities deemed to be causers of Facility Contingencies (see
Section 3 of this Appendix 2A: Applicable Facility Shares, and clause
3.3 of this Appendix 2A, which calculates the runway shares)</p>
<p>(b) Facilities deemed to be causers of Network Contingencies (see
Section 4 of this Appendix A: Network Contingency Shares, and clause 4.5
of this Appendix 2A, which calculates the runway shares)</p>
<p>Runway shares are calculated by ranking each Facility’s Facility Risk
value, and allocating them a share based on their rank (similar to the
calculation in Appendix 2 of the current WEM Rules).</p>
<p>1.5 Once the runway shares above have been calculated, participant
cost shares (<em>TotalRunwayShare(p,DI)</em>) are calculated in clause
5.3 of this Appendix 2A by taking into account:</p>
<p>(a) The Facility Component and Network Component ratios calculated in
clause 5.1 of this Appendix 2A</p>
<p>(b) The number of Network Contingencies tied as the Largest Credible
Supply Contingency (if any) in clause 5.2 of this Appendix 2A</p>
<p>(c) The facility runway shares and the network runway shares
calculated in clauses 3.3 and 4.5 of this Appendix 2A respectively.</p>
<p>Appendix 2A is also amended to include unregistered Energy Producing
Systems serving Intermittent Loads. If the Market Participant
responsible for the Non-Dispatchable Load portion of a Facility
containing an Intermittent Load is different from the Market Participant
responsible for the Registered Facility component, the runway share will
be allocated to:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>the Registered Facility when total facility export is greater
than the output of any one behind the meter unit; or</p></li>
<li><p>the Non-Dispatchable Load when the output of any one behind the
meter unit is greater than total Facility export.</p></li>

1\. Interpretation and calculation of a Market Participant's Total
Runway Share

1.1 Where anything is to be determined, calculated or done in this
Appendix 2A, then except where otherwise stated, AEMO will determine,
calculate or do, as the case may be, those things.

1.2 AEMO must calculate a Market Participant's total runway share of
procuring Contingency Reserve Raise and the Additional RoCoF Requirement
component of RoCoF Control Service in Dispatch Interval DI by following
each of the steps set out in the rest of this Appendix 2A.

1.3 Each electricity producing unit in an Energy Producing System
supplying an Intermittent Load to which clause 2.1(c) of this Appendix
2A applies is treated as a separate Facility for the purposes of this

Appendix 2C: SESSM refund calculation method

1\. Interpretation

1.1 Where anything is to be determined, calculated or done in this
Appendix 2C, then except where otherwise stated, AEMO will determine,
calculate or do, as the case may be, those things.

2\. Supplementary Essential System Service Mechanism refund calculation
methodology

2.1 AEMO must calculate the refund payable by a Market Participant in
respect of their Registered Facility for not meeting the SESSM
Availability Requirements set out in the relevant SESSM Awards by
following each of the steps set out in the rest of this Appendix 2C.

or MWs quantity of Essential System Service the Facility was already
accredited for at the time of making the SESSM Submission that resulted
in award a. The Base Quantity can be different in different Dispatch
Intervals. For example:</p></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><blockquote>
<p>Facility X has been accredited for 25MW of Contingency Reserve Raise
(with no SESSM triggered). A SESSM is triggered and Facility X has now
been awarded an Availability Quantity of 15 MW in all Dispatch Intervals
(under award a). The Base ESS Quantity or Base Quantity(a, DI) =
25MW.</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote>
<p>Facility Y is a new Facility, and is applying under a SESSM to
provide FCESS. Y is awarded an Availability Quantity of 10MW in all
Dispatch Intervals, under award a1. The Base Quantity(a, DI) = 0 MW for
all Dispatch Intervals (because it was not accredited previously). At a
later stage, it undergoes an upgrade, and under SESSM Award a2, it is
awarded an additional Availability Quantity (over and above a1) of 5MW
in all Dispatch Intervals. Base Quantity(a2,DI) = 10 MW, which is the
maximum that Y was accredited for under award a1 (at the time they were
awarded a2).</p>
</blockquote></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><p>The AvailabilityQuantity(a,DI) or Availability Quantity, denotes
the MW or MWs quantity of the ESS the Facility must offer in addition to
the Base ESS Quantity in a given Dispatch in at least
MinAvailability(a)% (see below) of the time during the SESSM Service
Timing. The Availability Quantity can be different in different Dispatch
Intervals. The Market Participant must offer the sum of the relevant
Availability Quantity and Base ESS Quantity (for a given SESSM Award
a):</p></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><blockquote>
<p>In the example above, Facility X, must offer 25MW (Base ESS Quantity)
+ 15MW (Availability Quantity) = 40 MW in all Dispatch Intervals</p>
</blockquote></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><blockquote>
<p>In the second example, above:</p>
</blockquote>
<p> Under award a1, Y must provide offer 0MW (Base ESS Quantity) + 10MW
(Availability Quantity) = 10 MW in all Dispatch Intervals.</p>
<p> Under award a2, Y must provide offer 10MW (Base ESS Quantity) + 5MW
(Availability Quantity) = 15 MW in all Dispatch Intervals</p></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><p>The AvailabilityPayment(a,DI) or Per-Dispatch Interval
Availability Payment, is the price per Dispatch Interval that the Market
Participant will be paid for offering the Availability Quantity in a

where the Availability Quantity is zero, and is a flat $/Dispatch
Interval figure in Dispatch Intervals where Availability Quantity is
non-zero.</p></li>
<li><p>MinAvailability(a) or SESSM Minimum Availability Requirement,
denotes the % of relevant Dispatch Intervals that the Market Participant
must make the sum of the AvailabilityQuantity(a,DI) and

of that quantity available at least MinAvailability % of the applicable
Dispatch Intervals).</p></li>

<p>Appendix 3 is amended to:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>remove the Reserve Capacity Auction; and</p></li>
<li><p>prescribe the prioritisation order for determining Network Access
Quantities (<strong>NAQ</strong>) for Facilities for a Reserve Capacity
Cycle (<strong>RCC</strong>).</p></li>
</ul>
<p>This Appendix should be read in conjunction with new proposed section
4.15 – Network Access Quantity.</p>
<p>The <em>Wholesale Electricity Market Amendment (Reserve Capacity
Pricing Reforms) Rules 2019</em> that commenced on 22 February 2020
introduced new provisions for assigning Capacity Credits in scenarios
where no new Facilities wish to receive a fixed Reserve Capacity Price
(<strong>Scenario 1</strong>) and where one or more new Facilities wish
to receive a fixed Reserve Capacity Price (<strong>Scenario
2</strong>).</p>
<p>The NAQ determination process has been designed to accommodate the
changes to the prioritisation order that was introduced by the Reserve
Capacity Mechanism (<strong>RCM</strong>) pricing reforms.</p>
<p><strong>Scenario 1 – there are no nominated Fixed Price
Facilities</strong></p>
<p>If the Reserve Capacity Requirement (<strong>RCR</strong>) is not met
after an NAQ is determined for all existing and committed Facilities,
AEMO will determine a NAQ for proposed Facilities, applying a new
prioritisation order, until the RCR is achieved or there are no
Facilities left.</p>
<p>In accordance with the new prioritisation order, AEMO will not select
a proposed Facility where the NAQ determined for the Facility is less
than a specified minimum quantity of Capacity Credits (the quantity of
which is based on the facility's NAQ) for the Facility to participate in
the RCM.</p>
<p>For the purposes of determining an NAQ for each Facility, using the
NAQ Model to be developed by AEMO in accordance with section 4.15, AEMO
will be required to determine a preliminary NAQ for each Facility and
then adjust (which can only be upwards in a subsequent step) that
preliminary NAQ as preliminary NAQs for other Facilities are
progressively determined in the priority order.</p>
<p><strong>Scenario 2 – there are nominated Fixed Price
Facilities</strong></p>
<p>The process for Scenario 2 is similar to Scenario 1 with some
modifications to reflect the existing priority order with respect to
Facilities that wish to receive a fixed Reserve Capacity Price.</p>
<p>Specifically, unless there is a shortfall in an Availability Class,
NAQs will be determined for Facilities wishing to receive a fixed
Reserve Capacity Price only if the NAQs determined for new market price
Facilities and existing capacity providers is less than the RCR +
3%.</p>
<p>Where there is a shortfall in an Availability Class, NAQs will be
determined for new Facilities that wish to receive a fixed Reserve
Capacity Price that are committed and proposed Facilities, in accordance
with a prioritisation order that includes other Facilities, until the
shortfall is fully covered or there are no Facilities left in the NAQ
Model without a preliminary NAQ (excluding Facilities where the
preliminary NAQ is less than the specified minimum quantity of Capacity
Credits for the facility to participate in the RCM).</p>
<p>However, Appendix 3 is also amended by the Miscellaneous Amendments
No. 1. As Appendix 3 is amended to reflect the amendments contained in
the Tranches 2 and 3 Amendments, as those amending rules (made by the
Minister at the date this companion version was prepared) will be
commenced last, please refer to the Miscellaneous Amendments No. 1 to

Appendix 3: Determination of Network Access Quantities

The objectives of this appendix are:

1.  To prevent AEMO determining Network Access Quantities (and assigning
    Capacity Credits) for Facilities that have been assigned Certified
    Reserve Capacity that have insufficient access to the Network and
    availability to usefully address the Reserve Capacity Requirement. A
    single algorithm is used for testing of Certified Reserve Capacity
    and for determining whether, in respect of a Reserve Capacity Cycle,
    a Network Access Quantity will be determined for any new Candidate
    Fixed Price Facilities for the current Reserve Capacity Cycle. The
    process is:

-   where the Facilities, for which Capacity Credits for the current
    > Reserve Capacity Cycle are being sought, do not include a
    > Candidate Fixed Price Facility, set out in Part A; and

-   where the Facilities, for which Capacity Credits for the current
    > Reserve Capacity Cycle are being sought, include a Candidate Fixed
    > Price Facility, set out in Part B.

Augmentation Funding Facility) or an Indicative NAQ for the Facility. A
Facility to which Early Certified Reserve Capacity has been assigned
will only be assigned a Final NAQ (and Capacity Credits) in Year 1 of
the RCC to which the application for Early Certified Reserve Capacity
relates, and subsequently receive the same treatment as other Facilities
holding Capacity Credits and a NAQ.</p></th>

<th><p><strong>Explanatory Note</strong></p>
<p>For the 2022 RCC, in which NAQs are to be first determined for
Facilities, AEMO must determine preliminary NAQs for existing and
committed Facilities that are not GIA Facilities, prior to determining
preliminary NAQs for all other Facilities in accordance with the
processes in this Appendix.</p>
<p>At Steps 3A, 3B and 3C, AEMO is required to determine a "preliminary
NAQ" for Facilities for which an NAQ was determined in the RCC
immediately preceding the current RCC, and for Early CRC Facilities
where the current RCC relates to the RCC in which the Facility's Reserve
Capacity will be delivered.</p>
<p>The intent of classifying the NAQ as "preliminary" is because as
other groups of Facilities are added to the NAQ Model and NAQs
determined for them in a subsequent step, an earlier NAQ determination
may need to be adjusted (upwards only). The intent is at the end of all
relevant steps, the preliminary NAQ (as may have been adjusted) is
recorded as the Final NAQ for the Facility. The Final NAQ for a Facility
determines the number of Capacity Credits assigned to the Facility for
the RCC.</p>
<p>The intent of Step 3A is for AEMO to determine a preliminary NAQ for
each Facility by assessing whether the existing NAQ determined for the
Facility in the RCC immediately preceding the current RCC is in order
for the current RCC (0 to min(CRC, current NAQ). In other words:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><blockquote>
<p>verify that the Facility has been assigned Certified Reserve Capacity
in the current RCC (equal to or greater than the NAQ determined for the
Facility in the RCC immediately preceding the current RCC; then</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote>
<p>if the amount of CRC assigned to the Facility in the current RCC is
lower than the NAQ in 1, reduce the NAQ to the amount specified to be
bilaterally traded for the Facility in the current RCC; then</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote>
<p>check whether there has been any organic changes in the network that
reduces the transfer capability of the network and, reduce the NAQ for
affected Facilities accordingly.</p>
</blockquote></li>
</ol>
<p>The intent of Steps 3B and 3C is for AEMO to determine whether there
is NAQ available to NAQ Facilities up to their Highest NAQ (PNAQ to
min(CRC, HNAQ)) and then up to the Certified Reserve Capacity assigned
to the Facility (PNAQ to CRC) respectively.</p>
<p>AEMO is also required to determine (and adjust (upwards only) in a
subsequent step) an Indicative NAQ for Early CRC Facilities (excluding
Early CRC Facilities that are also Network Augmented Funding Facilities)
where the RCC is the "intervening" year for these Facilities.</p></th>

2\. each Indicative NAQ Facility; then

ii\. repeat Steps 3A, 3B and 3C with all NAQ Facilities and Indicative

Appendix 4A: Individual Intermittent Load Reserve Capacity Requirements

This Appendix describes how the Individual Intermittent Load Reserve
Capacity Requirement for Intermittent Load k for Trading Month n is
determined.

The Individual Intermittent Load Reserve Capacity Requirement is only to
be determined for Intermittent Loads that are and continue to be deemed
to be Intermittent Loads under clause 1.48.2.

Define:

-   MaxL(k) is the nominated load level for Intermittent Load k to apply
    for Trading Month n as specified in clause 4.28.8(c);

-   RM is the reserve margin for the Reserve Capacity Cycle defined as
    negative one plus the ratio of the Reserve Capacity Requirement for
    the relevant Capacity Year as described in clause 4.6.1 and the
    expected peak demand for the relevant Capacity Year as described in
    clause 4.6.2;

Calculate Req(k), which equals MaxL(k) multiplied by RM.

When setting the Individual Intermittent Load Reserve Capacity
Requirement for an Intermittent Load k for a Trading Month n in
accordance with Appendix 5:

-   If, at the time AEMO determines the Indicative Individual Reserve
    Capacity Requirements for Trading Month n, Intermittent Load k is
    registered and operating or AEMO reasonably expects it to be
    registered and operating during Trading Month n (based on
    information provided to AEMO in accordance with clause 4.28.8(c)),
    then set the Individual Intermittent Load Reserve Capacity
    Requirement for Intermittent Load k equal to Req(k).

-   If, at the time AEMO determines the Indicative Individual Reserve
    Capacity Requirements for Trading Month n, AEMO reasonably expects
    Intermittent Load k not to be registered or operating during Trading
    Month n (based on information provided to AEMO in accordance with
    clause 4.28.8(c)), then set the Individual Intermittent Load Reserve
    Capacity Requirement for Intermittent Load k equal to zero.

Appendix 5: Individual Reserve Capacity Requirements

This Appendix presents the method that must be used by AEMO to
determine, for a Trading Month n:

-   Individual Reserve Capacity Requirement Contributions as required
    for the determination of Relevant Demands under clause 4.26.2CA;

-   Indicative Individual Reserve Capacity Requirements as required
    under clause 4.28.6;

-   Individual Reserve Capacity Requirements as required under clause
    4.28.7; and

-   revised Individual Reserve Capacity Requirements as required under
    clause 4.28.11A.

AEMO must perform Steps 1 to 10A to determine the Indicative Individual
Reserve Capacity Requirements, Individual Reserve Capacity Requirements
or revised Individual Reserve Capacity Requirements for Trading Month n.

AEMO must perform Step 11 as required to determine the Individual
Reserve Capacity Requirement Contribution of an individual metered
Associated Load for Trading Month n, using as input the relevant values
calculated by AEMO when it determined the Indicative Individual Reserve
Capacity Requirements for Trading Month n.

For the purpose of this Appendix:

1\. All references, apart from those in Step 5A, to meters are interval
meters.

2\. The Notional Wholesale Meter is to be treated as a registered
interval meter measuring Temperature Dependent Load. This meter is
denoted by Temperature Dependent Load meter v=v\*.

3\. The New Notional Wholesale Meter, determined in accordance with Step
5A, is to be treated as a registered interval meter measuring
Temperature Dependent Load.

4\. A meter measuring a Facility containing an Intermittent Load, that
is and continues to be deemed to be an Intermittent Load under clause
1.48.2, is to be included in these calculations as if it were two
meters, one representing the Intermittent Load and included in the set
indexed by w, and one representing other load at the Facility and
included in the set indexed by u or v as applicable, with metered
consumption calculated according to clause 2.30B.10 and clause 11 of
this Appendix 5.

5\. A meter measuring a Facility containing an Intermittent Load, for
which an application was approved under clause 2.30B.6 on or after New
WEM Commencement Day, is to be included in these calculations as a
single meter representing a Non-Dispatchable Load and included in the
set indexed by u or v as applicable, with metered consumption calculated
according to clause 2.30B.11 and clause 12 of this Appendix 5.

6\. The meter registration data to be used in the calculations is to be
the most current complete set of meter registration data as at the time
of commencing the calculations.

7\. The 12 Peak SWIS Trading Intervals to be used in the calculations
are the 12 Peak SWIS Trading Intervals determined and published by AEMO
under clause 4.1.23A for the Hot Season preceding the start of the
Capacity Year in which Trading Month n falls (the “preceding Hot
Season”).

8\. The 4 Peak SWIS Trading Intervals for a Trading Month to be used in
the calculations are the 4 Peak SWIS Trading Intervals determined and
published by AEMO under clause 4.1.23B for that Trading Month.

9\. When calculating the Indicative Individual Reserve Capacity
Requirements it is assumed that all meters registered to a Market
Participant on the day of calculation will remain registered to that
Market Participant for the entirety of Trading Month n.

10\. A meter measuring a Scheduled Facility, Semi-Scheduled Facility or
Non-Scheduled Facility not containing an Intermittent Load is to be
included in these calculations and included in the set indexed by u or v
as applicable, with metered consumption calculated in accordance with
clause 12 of this Appendix 5.

11\. Each meter measuring an Aggregated Facility is to be included as a
separate meter and included in the set indexed by u or v as applicable,
with metered consumption calculated in accordance with clause 12 of this
Appendix 5.

12\. Metered consumption for meter m, in Trading Interval t, is zero
when AEMO issues a direction under clause 7.7.5 in respect of an
Electric Storage Resource associated with m for a Dispatch Interval
within t, otherwise it is -1 x min(0, SOMS(m, t)), where SOMS(m, t) is
the Sent Out Metered Schedule of m in t.

Step 1: Calculate:

RR = min(RCR, CC)

FL = FL\_RCR × RR / RCR

where:

RCR is the Reserve Capacity Requirement for the relevant Reserve
Capacity Cycle

CC is the total number of Capacity Credits assigned for Trading Month n
at the time of the calculation

FL\_RCR is the peak demand associated with the Reserve Capacity
Requirement for the relevant Reserve Capacity Cycle as specified in
clause 4.6.2

Step 2: For each meter, u, measuring Non-Temperature Dependent Load that
was registered with AEMO for all of the 12 Peak SWIS Trading Intervals
determine NTDL(u), where:

> NTDL(u) is the contribution to the system peak load of meter u during
> the preceding Hot Season where this contribution is double the median
> value of the metered consumption during the 12 Peak SWIS Trading
> Intervals

Step 3: For each meter, v, measuring Temperature Dependent Load that was
registered with AEMO for all of the 12 Peak SWIS Trading Intervals
determine TDL(v), where:

> TDL(v) is the contribution to the system peak load of meter v during
> the preceding Hot Season where this contribution is double the median
> value of the metered consumption during the 12 Peak SWIS Trading
> Intervals

Step 4: For each Intermittent Load meter w set its Individual
Intermittent Load Reserve Capacity Requirement, IILRCR(w), to equal the
amount defined in accordance with Appendix 4A.

Step 5: Identify meters that were not registered with AEMO during one or
more of the 12 Peak SWIS Trading Intervals but which were registered by
the end of Trading Month n.

> For a new meter u that measures Non-Temperature Dependent Load set
> NMNTCR(u) to be 1.1 times the MW figure formed by doubling the median
> value of the metered consumption for that meter during the 4 Peak SWIS
> Trading Intervals of Trading Month n-3.
>
> For a new meter v that measures Temperature Dependent Load set
> NMTDCR(v) to be 1.3 times the MW figure formed by doubling the median
> value of the metered consumption for that meter during the 4 Peak SWIS
> Trading Intervals of Trading Month n-3.

Step 5A:

> Find the MW figure formed by doubling the median value of the metered
> consumption for the Notional Wholesale Meter v\*, during the 4 Peak
> SWIS Trading Intervals of Trading Month n-3 (“Median Notional
> Wholesale Meter”).
>
> Divide the Median Notional Wholesale Meter by the number of
> non-interval or accumulation meters that existed at the end of Trading
> Month n-3 (“Average Non - Interval Meter”).
>
> Subtract the number of non-interval or accumulation meters
> disconnected between the end of the preceding Hot Season and the end
> of Trading Month n-3 from the number of non-interval or accumulation
> meters connected between the end of the preceding Hot Season and the
> end of Trading Month n-3 (“Non-Interval Meter Growth”).
>
> Multiply the Non-Interval Meter Growth and the Average Non-Interval
> Meter. (“New Notional Wholesale Meter”).
>
> For the New Notional Wholesale Meter set NMTDCR(v) equal to be 1.3
> times the New Notional Wholesale Meter.

Step 6: Calculate the values of d(u,i) for Non-Temperature Dependent
Load, d(v,i) for Temperature Dependent Loads and d(w,i) for Intermittent
Loads such that:

-   d(u,i) has a value of zero if meter u measures Intermittent Load or
    was not registered to Market Participant i during Trading Month n,
    otherwise it has a value equal to the number of full Trading Days
    the meter was registered to Market Participant i in Trading Month n
    divided by the number of days in Trading Month n.

-   d(v,i) has a value of zero if meter v measures Intermittent Load or
    was not registered to Market Participant i during Trading Month n,
    otherwise it has a value equal to the number of full Trading Days
    the meter was registered to Market Participant i in Trading Month n
    divided by the number of days in Trading Month n.

-   d(w,i) has a value of zero if meter w was not registered to Market
    Participant i during Trading Month n, otherwise it has a value of
    one if Market Participant i nominated capacity for the Intermittent
    Load measured by meter w in accordance with clause 4.28.8(c), with
    the exception that if the Intermittent Load was for Load at a meter
    registered to Market Participant i for only part of Trading Month n,
    then it has a value equal to the number of full Trading Days that
    meter was registered to Market Participant i in Trading Month n
    divided by the number of days in Trading Month n.

Step 7: Identify the set NM of all those new meters v that measured
consumption that was measured by meter v=v\* during the preceding Hot
Season and set TDLn(v) for meter v=v\* to equal:

> TDLn(v\*) = TDL(v\*) – Sum(v∈NM, NMTDCR(v))

Step 8: For each Market Participant i, calculate:

> ILRCR(i) = Sum(IILRCR(w) × d(w,i))

Step 8A: Calculate:

> NRR = RR – Sum(i, ILRCR(i))
>
> NTDL\_Ratio = NRR / FL

Step 8B: For each Market Participant i, calculate:

> NTDLRCR(i) = Sum(NTDL(u) × d(u,i)) × NTDL\_Ratio

Step 8C: Calculate:

> TDL\_Ratio = (NRR ‑ Sum(i, NTDLRCR(i))) /  
> Sum(i, Sum(MTDL(v) × d(v,i)))
>
> where
>
> MTDL(v) = TDL(v) for all v except v\* and  
> MTDL(v) = TDLn(v\*) for v=v\*

Step 8D: For each Market Participant i, calculate:

> TDLRCR(i) = (Sum MTDL(v) × d(v,i)) × TDL\_Ratio

Step 9: For each Market Participant i, calculate

> X(i) = Sum(i, ILRCR(i) + NTDLRCR(i) + TDLRCR(i)) + Sum(u, NMNTCR(u) ×
> d(u,i)) + Sum(v, NMTDCR(v) × d(v,i))

Step 10: Calculate:

> Total\_Ratio = RR / Sum(i, X(i))

Step 10A: For each Market Participant i, set the Indicative Individual
Reserve Capacity Requirement or Individual Reserve Capacity Requirement,
as applicable, for Trading Month n to:

> X(i) × Total\_Ratio

Step 11: The Individual Reserve Capacity Requirement Contribution of an
individual metered Associated Load for Trading Month n of a Capacity
Year is determined as follows:

> \(a\) for meter u at a connection point measuring Non-Temperature
> Dependent Load that was registered with AEMO for all of the 12 Peak
> SWIS Trading Intervals equals (NTDL(u) x NTDL\_Ratio x Total\_Ratio);
>
> \(b\) for meter v at a connection point measuring Temperature
> Dependent Load that was registered with AEMO for all of the 12 Peak
> SWIS Trading Intervals equals (TDL(v) x TDL\_Ratio x Total\_Ratio);
>
> \(c\) for meter u at a new connection point identified in Step 5
> measuring Non-Temperature Dependent Load equals (NMNTCR(u) x
> Total\_Ratio); and
>
> \(d\) for meter v at a new connection point identified in Step 5
> measuring Temperature Dependent Load equals (NMTDCR(v) x
> Total\_Ratio).

Appendix 5A: Non-Temperature Dependent Load Requirements

This Appendix specifies how AEMO must determine whether or not to accept
a Load measured by an interval meter nominated in accordance with
clauses 4.28.8(a) or 4.28.8C as a Non-Temperature Dependent Load for the
purposes of clause 4.28.9.

For the purpose of this Appendix:

-   AEMO must use the current set of meter data (as at the time when it
    commences its calculations);

-   the 4 Peak SWIS Trading Intervals in a Trading Month are the 4 Peak
    SWIS Trading Intervals determined and published by AEMO under clause
    4.1.23B for that Trading Month; and

    AEMO must treat each connection point measured by an interval meter
    measuring a Scheduled Facility, Semi-Scheduled Facility or
    Non‑Scheduled Facility as if it were a separate Non-Dispatchable
    Load.

AEMO must perform the following steps (in sequential order) when
determining whether or not to accept a Load measured by an interval
meter nominated in accordance with clauses 4.28.8(a) or 4.28.8C as a
Non-Temperature Dependent Load for the purposes of clause 4.28.9:

Step 1:

-   If, in accordance with clause 4.28.8(a), the Market Participant
    provides AEMO in Trading Month n-2 with the identity of an interval
    meter associated with that Market Participant which measures a Load
    that it nominates as a Non-Temperature Dependent Load from Trading
    Month n;

-   If the identity of the interval meter is provided by the date and
    time specified in clause 4.1.23; and

-   If the Load was treated as a Non-Temperature Dependent Load in
    Trading Month n-8,

then AEMO must accept the Load as a Non-Temperature Dependent Load if:

\(a\) the median value of the metered consumption for the Load,
calculated for the set of Trading Intervals defined as the 4 Peak SWIS
Trading Intervals in each of the Trading Months starting from the start
of Trading Month n-11 to the end of Trading Month n-3, exceeded 1.0 MWh;
and

\(b\) the metered consumption for the Load did not deviate downwards
from the median value in paragraph (a) by more than 10% for more than
10% of the time during the period from the start of Trading Month n-11
to the end of Trading Month n-3, except during Trading Intervals for
which:

i\. the metered consumption was 0 MWh; or

ii\. consumption was reduced at the request of AEMO; or

iii\. AEMO has accepted a Consumption Deviation Application for the Load
under clause 4.28.9D.

Step 2:

-   If, in accordance with clauses 4.28.8(a) or 4.28.8C, the Market
    Participant provides AEMO in Trading Month n-2 with the identity of
    an interval meter associated with that Market Participant which
    measures a Load that it nominates as a Non-Temperature Dependent
    Load from Trading Month n;

-   If the Load was not treated as a Non-Temperature Dependent Load in
    Trading Month n-1; and

-   If the Load was not treated as a Non-Temperature Dependent Load for
    any of the Trading Months in the Capacity Year in which Trading
    Month n falls,

then AEMO must accept the Load as a Non-Temperature Dependent Load for
Trading Month n if:

\(a\) the median value of the metered consumption for the Load during
the 4 Peak SWIS Trading Intervals in Trading Month n-3 exceeded 1.0 MWh;
and

\(b\) the metered consumption for the Load did not deviate downwards
from the median value in paragraph (a) by more than 10% for more than
10% of the time during Trading Month n-3, except during Trading
Intervals for which:

i\. the metered consumption was 0 MWh; or

ii consumption was reduced at the request of AEMO; or

iii\. AEMO has accepted a Consumption Deviation Application for the Load
under clause 4.28.9D.

Step 3:

-   If a Load was not accepted under Step 1 as a Non-Temperature
    Dependent Load for Trading Month n; and

-   If the Load was accepted under Step 2, or previously under this Step
    3, as a Non-Temperature Dependent Load for Trading Month n-1,

then AEMO must accept the Load as a Non-Temperature Dependent Load for
Trading Month n if:

\(a\) the median value of the metered consumption for the Load,
calculated for the set of Trading Intervals defined as the 4 Peak SWIS
Trading Intervals in each of the Trading Months commencing at the start
of the Trading Month for which metered consumption was used by AEMO to
accept the Load as a Non-Temperature Dependent Load under Step 2 to the
end of Trading Month n-3, exceeded 1.0 MWh; and

\(b\) the metered consumption for the Load did not deviate downwards
from the median value in paragraph (a) by more than 10% for more than
10% of the time during the period from the start of the Trading Month
for which metered consumption was used by AEMO to accept the Load as a
Non-Temperature Dependent Load under Step 2 to the end of Trading Month
n-3, except during Trading Intervals for which:

i\. the metered consumption was 0 MWh; or

ii\. consumption was reduced at the request of AEMO; or

iii\. AEMO has accepted a Consumption Deviation Application for the Load
under clause 4.28.9D.

Step 4:

Otherwise, AEMO must treat a Load as a Temperature Dependent Load.

Appendix 6: STEM Price Curve Determination

The first part of this appendix describes a process for converting a
Market Participant’s Portfolio Supply Curve and Portfolio Demand Curve
into a single STEM Price Curve and to then convert a Market
Participant’s STEM Price Curve into STEM Bids and STEM Offers relative
to its Net Bilateral Position.

For each Market Participant and for each Trading Interval in the Trading
Day except those for which AEMO has recorded that the Market Participant
has not made a STEM Submission:

\(a\) Determine for every price between the Energy Offer Price Floor and
the Energy Offer Price Ceiling:

i\. the maximum cumulative quantity the Market Participant is prepared
to sell into the STEM from all of its Price-Quantity Pairs in its
Portfolio Supply Curve;

ii\. the minimum cumulative quantity the Market Participant is prepared
to sell into the STEM from all of its Price-Quantity Pairs in its
Portfolio Supply Curve;

iii\. the maximum cumulative quantity the Market Participant is prepared
to buy from the STEM from all of its Price-Quantity Pairs in its
Portfolio Demand Curve;

iv\. the minimum cumulative quantity the Market Participant is prepared
to buy from the STEM from all of its Price-Quantity Pairs in its
Portfolio Demand Curve;

v\. the STEM Price Curve quantity for that price where:

1\. the minimum STEM Price Curve quantity for that price equals the
value in Appendix 6(a)(ii) less the value in Appendix 6(a)(iii);

2\. the maximum STEM Price Curve quantity for that price equals the
value in Appendix 6(a)(i) less the value in Appendix 6(a)(iv); and

3\. the STEM Price Curve for that price includes all quantities between
those in Appendix 6(a)(v)(1) and Appendix 6(a)(v)(2).

\(b\) If the minimum of the quantities determined under Appendix
6(a)(v)(1) for the Market Participant for the Trading Interval is
greater than the Net Bilateral Position of the Market Participant in the
Trading Interval then:

i\. if, for every price between the Energy Offer Price Floor and the
Energy Offer Price Ceiling, the quantity determined under Appendix
6(a)(v)(1) is equal to the quantity determined under Appendix
6(a)(v)(2), then amend the STEM Price Curve for the Energy Offer Price
Floor to include all quantities between the Net Bilateral Position of
the Market Participant and the quantity determined for the Energy Offer
Price Floor under Appendix 6(a)(v)(2); and

ii\. otherwise, amend the STEM Price Curve for the lowest price for
which the quantity determined under Appendix 6(a)(v)(1) is not equal to
the quantity determined under Appendix 6(a)(v)(2), to include all
quantities between the Net Bilateral Position of the Market Participant
and the quantity determined for the price under Appendix 6(a)(v)(2).

\(c\) If the maximum of the quantities determined under Appendix
6(a)(v)(2) for the Market Participant for the Trading Interval is less
than the Net Bilateral Position of the Market Participant then:

i\. if, for every price between the Energy Offer Price Floor and the
Energy Offer Price Ceiling, the quantity determined under Appendix
6(a)(v)(1) is equal to the quantity determined under Appendix
6(a)(v)(2), then amend the STEM Price Curve for the Energy Offer Price
Ceiling to include all quantities between the quantity determined for
the Energy Offer Price Ceiling under Appendix 6(a)(v)(1) and the Net
Bilateral Position of the Market Participant; and

ii\. otherwise, amend the STEM Price Curve for the highest price for
which the quantity determined under Appendix 6(a)(v)(1) is not equal to
the quantity determined under Appendix 6(a)(v)(2), to include all
quantities between the quantity determined for the price under Appendix
6(a)(v)(1) and the Net Bilateral Position of the Market Participant.

\(d\) If the Net Bilateral Position equals the minimum STEM Price Curve
quantity then there are no STEM Bids, otherwise:

i\. for the STEM Price Curve between the minimum STEM Price Curve
quantity and the Net Bilateral Position of that Market Participant
identify each price for which more than one STEM Price Curve quantity is
defined;

ii\. for each price identified in Appendix 6(d)(i) identify the minimum
STEM Price Curve quantity for which that price applies, such that the
STEM Price Curve quantity lies between the minimum STEM Price Curve
quantity and the Net Bilateral Position;

iii\. for each price identified in Appendix 6(d)(i) identify the maximum
STEM Price Curve quantity for which that price applies, such that the
STEM Price Curve quantity lies between the minimum STEM Price Curve
quantity and the Net Bilateral Position;

iv\. for each price identified in Appendix 6(d)(i) set a Price-Quantity
Pair price equal to that price;

v\. for each price identified in Appendix 6(d)(i) set a Price-Quantity
Pair quantity equal to the quantity defined in Appendix 6(d)(iii) less
the quantity defined in Appendix 6(d)(ii); and

vi\. set the Market Participant’s STEM Bids to be the set of
Price-Quantity Pairs defined in Appendix 6(d)(iv) and Appendix 6(d)(v)
where each Price-Quantity Pair means that the Market Participant is
prepared to buy a quantity of energy from the STEM for that
Price-Quantity Pair equal to:

1\. 0 MWh if the STEM Clearing Price is greater than the Price-Quantity
Pair price;

2\. the Price-Quantity Pair quantity if the STEM Clearing Price is less
than the Price-Quantity Pair price; and

3\. an amount between 0 MWh and the Price-Quantity Pair quantity if the
STEM Clearing Price equals the Price-Quantity Pair price.

\(e\) If the Net Bilateral Position equals the maximum STEM Price Curve
quantity then there are no STEM Offers, otherwise:

i\. for the STEM Price Curve between the Net Bilateral Position of that
Market Participant and the maximum STEM Price Curve quantity identify
each price for which more than one STEM Price Curve quantity is defined;

ii\. for each price identified in Appendix 6(e)(i) identify the minimum
STEM Price Curve quantity for which that price applies, such that the
STEM Price Curve quantity lies between the Net Bilateral Position and
the maximum STEM Price Curve quantity;

iii\. for each price identified in Appendix 6(e)(i) identify the maximum
STEM Price Curve quantity for which that price applies, such that the
STEM Price Curve quantity lies between the minimum STEM Price Curve
quantity and the Net Bilateral Position;

iv\. for each price identified in Appendix 6(e)(i) set a Price-Quantity
Pair price equal to that price;

v\. for each price identified in Appendix 6(e)(i) set a Price-Quantity
Pair quantity equal to the quantity defined in Appendix 6(e)(iii) less

Appendix 9: Relevant Level Determination

Part A: Introduction

Interpretations and Definitions

A.1. This Appendix 9 presents the methodology for determining the
Relevant Levels for Candidate Facilities for a given Reserve Capacity
Cycle.

A.2. In this Appendix 9:

\(a\) a Candidate Facility is a Facility, or a component of a Facility,
for which:

i\. a Market Participant has applied for:

1\. Certified Reserve Capacity for the relevant Reserve Capacity Cycle
under section 4.9;

2\. Conditional Certified Reserve Capacity for a future Reserve Capacity
Cycle under section 4.9, where AEMO is required under clause 4.9.7A to
process the application at the time it processes applications for
Certified Reserve Capacity for the relevant Reserve Capacity Cycle; or

3\. Early Certified Reserve Capacity for a Reserve Capacity Cycle under
clause 4.28C.2, where AEMO is required to process the application at the
time it processes applications for Certified Reserve Capacity for the
relevant Reserve Capacity Cycle;

ii\. the Market Participant’s application includes all supporting
information required under section 4.10 or clause 4.28C.5 (as
applicable); and

iii\. the Certified Reserve Capacity, Conditional Certified Reserve
Capacity or Early Certified Reserve Capacity (as applicable) is required
to be determined in accordance with clause 4.11.2(b);

\(b\) the full operation date of a Candidate Facility for the relevant
Reserve Capacity Cycle (“Full Operation Date”) is:

i\. the date provided under clause 4.10.1(c)(iii)(7) or revised in
accordance with clause 4.27.11A, where at the time the application for
certification of Reserve Capacity is made the Candidate Facility is yet
to enter service; or

ii\. the date most recently provided for a Reserve Capacity Cycle under
clause 4.10.1(k) otherwise; and

\(c\) a Candidate Facility will be considered to be:

i\. a new Candidate Facility if the five-year period identified in
Step 1(a) of this Appendix 9 commenced before 8:00 AM on the Full
Operation Date for the Facility (“New Candidate Facility”); or

ii\. an existing Candidate Facility (“Existing Candidate Facility”)
otherwise.

A.3. AEMO must determine the Relevant Levels for Candidate Facilities
for a given Reserve Capacity Cycle by following each of the steps set
out in Part B of this Appendix 9.

Part B: Process Steps

***Determining Existing Facility Load for Scheduled Generation***

Step 1: Identify:

\(a\) the five year period ending at 8:00 AM on 1 April of Capacity Year
1 of the relevant Reserve Capacity Cycle;

\(b\) any 12 month period, from 1 April to 31 March, occurring during
the five year period identified in Step 1(a), where the 12 Trading
Intervals with the highest Existing Facility Load for Scheduled
Generation in that 12 month period have not previously been determined
under this Appendix 9; and

\(c\) any 12 month period, from 1 April to 31 March, occurring during
the five year period identified in Step 1(a), where the 12 Trading
Intervals with the highest Existing Facility Load for Scheduled
Generation in that 12 month period have previously been determined under
this Appendix 9.

Step 2: Determine the quantity of electricity (in MWh) sent out by each
Candidate Facility:

\(a\) using Facility Sub-Metering, where the Candidate Facility is a
component of a Facility for which Facility Sub-Metering is required to
be installed; and

\(b\) using Sent Out Metered Schedules, where the Candidate Facility is
not a component of a Facility for which Facility Sub-Metering is
required to be installed,

for each of the Trading Intervals in the period identified in Step 1(b).

Step 3: For each Candidate Facility, identify any Trading Intervals in
the period identified in Step 1(b) where:

\(a\) the Candidate Facility, other than a Facility in the Balancing
Portfolio, was directed to restrict its output under a Dispatch
Instruction as provided in a schedule under clause 7.13.1(c); or

\(b\) the Candidate Facility, if in the Balancing Portfolio, was
instructed by AEMO to deviate from its Dispatch Plan or change its
commitment or output as provided in a schedule under clause 7.13.1C(d);
or

\(c\) the Candidate Facility was affected by a Consequential Outage; or

\(d\) the Candidate Facility was directed to restrict its output under
an Operating Instruction issued in accordance with a NCESS Contract, as
provided in a schedule under clause 7.13.1(cC).

Step 4: For each Candidate Facility and Trading Interval identified in
Step 3(a):

\(a\) identify the actual quantity as determined in Step 2 if:

i\. AEMO has made a revised estimate of the maximum quantity in
accordance with clause 7.7.5A(c) and the WEM Procedure specified in
clause 7.7.5A; and

ii\. the revised estimate of the maximum quantity is lower than the
actual quantity as determined in Step 2;

\(b\) identify the actual quantity as determined in Step 2 if:

i\. Step 4(a) does not apply; and

ii\. the estimated maximum quantity determined by AEMO under clause
7.13.1(eF) is lower than the actual quantity as determined in Step 2;
and

\(c\) if Steps 4(a) and 4(b) do not apply:

i\. identify the revised estimate of the maximum quantity determined by
AEMO in accordance with the WEM Procedure specified in clause 7.7.5A; or

ii\. if there is no revised estimate, identify the estimate determined
by AEMO under clause 7.13.1(eF).

Step 5: For each Candidate Facility and Trading Interval identified in
Step 3(b) use:

\(a\) the estimate recorded by AEMO under clause 7.13.1C(e); and

\(b\) the quantity determined for the Candidate Facility and Trading
Interval in Step 2,

to estimate the quantity of energy (in MWh) that would have been sent
out by the Candidate Facility had it not complied with AEMO’s
instruction to change its commitment or output during the Trading
Interval.

Step 6: For each Candidate Facility and Trading Interval identified in
Step 3(c) use:

\(a\) the Unadjusted Consequential Outage Quantity for the Candidate
Facility for the Trading Interval;

\(b\) the quantity determined for the Candidate Facility and Trading
Interval in Step 2; and

\(c\) the information recorded by AEMO under clause 7.13.1C(a),

to estimate the quantity of energy (in MWh) that would have been sent
out by the Candidate Facility had it not been affected by the
Consequential Outage during the Trading Interval.

Step 6A: For each Candidate Facility and Trading Interval identified in
Step 3(d) use:

\(a\) the schedule of Operating Instructions determined by AEMO under
clause 7.13.1(cC);

\(b\) the quantity determined for the Candidate Facility and Trading
Interval in Step 2; and

\(c\) the information recorded by AEMO under clause 7.13.1C(a),

to estimate the quantity of energy (in MWh) that would have been sent
out by the Candidate Facility had it not been subject to an Operating
Instruction during the Trading Interval.

Step 7: Determine for each Trading Interval in each 12 month period
identified in Step 1(b) the Existing Facility Load for Scheduled
Generation (in MWh) as:

(Total\_Generation + DSP\_Reduction + Interruptible\_Reduction +
Involuntary\_Reduction) – CF\_Generation

where

Total\_Generation is the Total Sent Out Generation of all Registered
Facilities;

DSP\_Reduction is the total quantity of Deemed DSM Dispatch for all
Demand Side Programmes for that Trading Interval;

Interruptible\_Reduction is the total quantity by which all
Interruptible Loads reduced their consumption in accordance with the
terms of an Ancillary Service Contract, as recorded by AEMO under clause
7.13.1C(c);

Involuntary\_Reduction is the total quantity of energy not served due to
involuntary load shedding (manual and automatic), as recorded by AEMO
under clause 7.13.1C(b); and

CF\_Generation is the total sent out generation of all Candidate
Facilities, as determined in Step 2 or estimated in Steps 4, 5, 6 or 6A
as applicable.

Step 8: Determine for each 12 month period identified in Step 1(b) the
12 Trading Intervals, occurring on separate Trading Days, with the
highest Existing Facility Load for Scheduled Generation.

Step 9: Identify, for each 12 month period identified in Step 1(c), the
following:

\(a\) the Existing Facility Load for Scheduled Generation previously
determined under this Appendix 9 for each Trading Interval in the 12
month period;

\(b\) subject to Step 9A, the sent out generation (in MWh) for each
Candidate Facility and for each Trading Interval in that 12 month
period, where that sent out generation was used to determine the
CF\_Generation (which is one of the variables used to determine the
Existing Facility Load for Scheduled Generation in Step 7) for that
Trading Interval; and

\(c\) the 12 Trading Intervals occurring on separate Trading Days that
were previously determined to have the highest Existing Facility Load
for Scheduled Generation in the 12 month period.

Step 9A: For the purposes of Step 9(b), if:

\(a\) AEMO has determined a revised estimate of the maximum quantity in
accordance with the WEM Procedure specified in clause 7.7.5A;

\(b\) the revised estimate relates to a Candidate Facility and a Trading
Interval in a 12 month period identified in Step 1(c); and

\(c\) AEMO determined the sent out generation for that Candidate
Facility and for that Trading Interval in accordance with Step 4 before
it revised the estimate,

then AEMO must redetermine the sent out generation for that Candidate
Facility and that Trading Interval in accordance with Step 4.

***Determining New Facility Load for Scheduled Generation***

Step 10: For each New Candidate Facility determine, for each Trading
Interval in the period identified in Step 1(a) that falls before 8:00 AM
on the Full Operation Date for the Candidate Facility, an estimate of
the quantity of energy (in MWh) that would have been sent out by the
Candidate Facility in the Trading Interval, if it had been in operation
with the configuration proposed under clause 4.10.1(dA) in the relevant
application for certification of Reserve Capacity. The estimates must
reflect the estimates in the expert report provided for the Candidate
Facility under clause 4.10.3, unless AEMO reasonably considers the
estimates in the expert report to be inaccurate.

Step11: For each New Candidate Facility determine, for each Trading
Interval in the period identified in Step 1(a), the New Facility Load
for Scheduled Generation (in MWh) as:

\(a\) if the Trading Interval falls before 8:00 AM on the Full Operation
Date for the Facility:

EFLSG + Actual\_CF\_Generation – Estimated\_CF\_Generation

where

EFLSG is the Existing Facility Load for Scheduled Generation for the
Trading Interval, determined in Step 7 or identified in Step 9(a) as
applicable;

Actual\_CF\_Generation is the sent out generation of the New Candidate
Facility for the Trading Interval, as identified in Step 9(b),
determined in Step 2 or estimated in Steps 4, 5, 6 or 6A as applicable;
and

Estimated\_CF\_Generation is the quantity determined for the New
Candidate Facility and the Trading Interval in Step 10;

or

\(b\) the Existing Facility Load for Scheduled Generation for the
Trading Interval, otherwise.

Step 12: For each New Candidate Facility determine, for each 12 month
period identified in Step 1(a), the 12 Trading Intervals, occurring on
separate Trading Days, with the highest New Facility Load for Scheduled
Generation.

***Determining the Facility Average Performance Level***

Step 13: For each Existing Candidate Facility, determine the 60
quantities comprising:

\(a\) the MWh quantities determined in Step 2 or estimated in Steps 4,
5, 6 or 6A as applicable for each of the Trading Intervals determined in
Step 8, multiplied by 2 to convert to units of MW; and

\(b\) the MWh quantities determined in Step 9(b) for each of the Trading
Intervals identified in Step 9(c), multiplied by 2 to convert to units
of MW.

Step 14: For each New Candidate Facility, determine the 60 quantities
comprising:

\(a\) the MWh quantities identified in Step 9(b), determined in Step 2
or estimated in Steps 4, 5, 6 or 6A as applicable for each of the
Trading Intervals identified in Step 12 that fall after 8:00 AM on the
Full Operation Date for the Candidate Facility, multiplied by 2 to
convert to units of MW; and

\(b\) the MWh quantities determined in Step 10 for each of the Trading
Intervals identified in Step 12 that fall before 8:00 AM on the Full
Operation Date of the Candidate Facility, multiplied by 2 to convert to
units of MW.

Step 15: Determine the average performance level (in MW) for each
Candidate Facility f (“Facility Average Performance Level”) as the mean
of the 60 quantities determined for Candidate Facility f in Step 13 or
Step 14 as applicable.

***Determine the Facility Adjustment Factor***

Step 16: Determine the variance (in MW) for each Candidate Facility f
(“Facility Variance”) as the variance of the MW quantities determined
for Candidate Facility f in Step 13 or Step 14 as applicable.

Step 17: Determine the facility adjustment factor (in MW) for each
Candidate Facility f (“Facility Adjustment Factor”) in accordance with
the following formula:

Facility Adjustment Factor = min(G x Facility Variance (f), Facility
Average Performance Level (f) / 3 + K x Facility Variance (f))

Where

G = K + U / Facility Average Performance Level (f)

K is determined in accordance with the following table:

***Determining the Relevant Level for a Candidate Facility***

Step 18: Determine the Relevant Level for each Candidate Facility f (in
MW) in accordance with the following formula:

Relevant Level (f) = max(0, Facility Average Performance Level (f) -
Facility Adjustment Factor (f))

***Publication of information***

Step 19: Publish on the WEM Website by 1 June of Year 1 of the relevant
Reserve Capacity Cycle on a provisional basis:

\(a\) a forecast of the Trading Intervals that may be identified in Step
8; and

\(b\) a forecast of the Existing Facility Load for Scheduled Generation
quantities that may be determined in Step 7.

Step 20: Publish on the WEM Website within three Business Days after the
date specified in clause 4.1.11 (as modified or extended) for the
relevant Reserve Capacity Cycle:

\(a\) the Trading Intervals identified in Step 8; and

\(b\) the Existing Facility Load for Scheduled Generation quantities
determined in Step 7.

Step 21: Publish on the WEM Website the following information identified
for a Reserve Capacity Cycle under the Relevant Level Methodology:

\(a\) the Existing Facility Load for Scheduled Generation for each
Trading Interval in the five year period determined under Step 1(a) of
Appendix 9; and

\(b\) the 12 Trading Intervals occurring on separate Trading Days with
the highest Existing Facility Load for Scheduled Generation for each 12
month period in the five year period.

Appendix 10: Relevant Demand Determination

This Appendix sets out the 5th percentile methodology for determining
the Relevant Demand for each Demand Side Programme, for use in clause
4.26.2CA(a).

The Relevant Demand value is to be re-calculated for each Demand Side
Programme for each Trading Day.

**Step 1**

Identify the 200 Calendar Hours in the previous Capacity Year with the
highest Total Sent Out Generation. The Calendar Hours do not have to be
contiguous.

**Step 2**

For each Demand Side Programme, for each Calendar Hour identified in
Step 1, for each of the Demand Side Programme’s Associated Loads,
identify the quantity (expressed in MWh)[4] equal to—

\(a\) unless paragraphs (b) or (c) apply, the Associated Load’s metered
consumption for the two Trading Intervals in the Calendar Hour; or

\(b\) unless paragraph (c) applies, if the Associated Load’s metered
consumption is not available or is considered by AEMO to be
inappropriate, a quantity determined by AEMO based on—

i\. available Meter Data Submissions; or

ii\. Load information provided by the Market Participant; or

iii\. other relevant information; or

Appendix 12: Transmission Connected Generating System Generator
Performance Standards

This Appendix lists each of the Technical Requirements for Transmission
Connected Generating Systems and sets out the Ideal Generator
Performance Standard, Minimum Generator Performance Standard and any
applicable Common Requirements for each Technical Requirement.

Each Technical Requirement may specify Negotiation Criteria which must
be met if a Market Participant responsible for a Transmission Connected
Generating System submits a Proposed Negotiated Generator Performance
Standard.

If a Technical Requirement specifies Common Requirements, these apply
whether an Ideal Generator Performance Standard or Negotiated Generator
Performance Standard is intended to apply to a Transmission Connected
Generating System in respect of a Technical Requirement.

**Use of defined terms in this Appendix 12**

Terms defined in Part A12.1 of this Appendix 12 are defined for the
purposes of this Appendix alone and must not be used to infer the
meaning of those words, or other words, in these WEM Rules. Terms which
are defined in these WEM Rules will apply to this Appendix unless
defined in this Appendix or the context otherwise requires.

Where the terms Scheduled Generator and Non-Scheduled Generator are used
in this Appendix, in relation to generating works that are proposed to
be connected to a transmission system and is yet to be registered under
these WEM Rules as a Facility or a Facility that is undergoing an
upgrade that may impact its Facility Class, these terms are to be used
as they will ultimately apply to the relevant Facility.

The measurement location for each of the following terms, where they are
used in this Appendix, is as specified in the relevant clause or, where
applicable, by the relevant Network Operator in consultation with AEMO
and recorded in the relevant Generator Performance Standard:

\(a\) Rated Maximum Active Power;

\(b\) Rated Maximum Apparent Power;

\(c\) Maximum Continuous Current;

\(d\) Rated Minimum Active Power;

\(e\) Temperature Dependency Data; and

\(f\) Generator Performance Chart.

When producing electric power, Electricity Storage which is part of a
Generating System will be considered as Generation and must meet the
Technical Requirements of Appendix 12.

Where the term 'Technical Rules' is used in this Appendix then the
reference to the Technical Rules is to the Technical Rules of Western
Power for the SWIS.

Where terms defined in Technical Rules are used in this Appendix, then
any references to 'power system' in those definitions should be read as
the SWIS.

For ease of reference, a list of the Technical Requirements that apply
to Transmission Connected Generating Systems contained in this Appendix
is set out below.

“excludes” non-dispatchable storage, whereas the WEM Rules definition is
quite open-ended, as controllability comes down to how a Facility is
registered. This definition maintains, for GPS purposes, a limitation to
only storage devices that are dispatchable.</p></td>

the Generating System against any other Generating System or device, are
Adequately Damped;

the voltage control location agreed with AEMO and the Network Operator;
and

\(d\) has limiting devices to ensure that a voltage disturbance does not
cause a Generating Unit to trip at the limits of its operating
capability. The Generating System must be capable of continuous stable

\(a\) two washout filters for each input, with ability to bypass one of
them if necessary;
