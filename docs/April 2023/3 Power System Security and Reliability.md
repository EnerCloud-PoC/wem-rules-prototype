to must develop and maintain an UFLS Specification. The UFLS
Specification must set out how the Network Operator's schemes meet the
UFLS Requirements.

### 3.6.6. Each Network Operator must submit the UFLS Specification that it
has developed for its Network under clause 3.6.5 to AEMO for approval,
and following the initial approval of the UFLS Specification, whenever:

\(a\) the Network Operator seeks to amend its UFLS Specification; or

\(b\) amendments are required as a result of an amendment to the UFLS
Requirements.

### 3.6.7. Where AEMO receives an UFLS Specification from a Network Operator
under clause 3.6.6, AEMO must, within a reasonable timeframe agreed with
the relevant Network Operator, determine whether to approve or reject
the UFLS Specification or the amendment to it, as applicable. Where
AEMO:

\(a\) approves the UFLS Specification or the amendment to it, as
applicable, AEMO must notify the relevant Network Operator that the UFLS
Specification or the amendment to it, as applicable, has been approved;
or

\(b\) rejects the UFLS Specification or the amendment to it, as

reasonably required to the UFLS Specification, both parties acting
reasonably and in good faith; and

\(b\) must resubmit the UFLS Specification incorporating the amendments
requested by AEMO under clause 3.6.7(b)(ii) or as agreed with AEMO
pursuant to clause 3.6.8(a), as applicable, to AEMO for approval under
clause 3.6.7.

### 3.6.9. Each Network Operator must implement and maintain systems,
schemes or standards in accordance with its UFLS Specification, and must
agree a timeframe with AEMO for changes to its systems, schemes, or
standards triggered by any changes to its UFLS Specification.

### 3.6.10. Each Network Operator must, in respect of its Network, provide a
report to AEMO on the compliance of its UFLS Specification with the UFLS
Requirements:

\(a\) annually, on the projected ability to meet the requirements over a
future ten-year horizon; and

\(b\) within a timeframe agreed with AEMO, both parties acting
reasonably, following each under frequency load shedding event.

### 3.6.11. Without limiting AEMO's ability to amend the UFLS Requirements
in accordance with this section 3.6, AEMO must review the UFLS
Requirements to ensure they are appropriate and consistent with the
requirements of this section 3.6 within three years of the date the UFLS
Requirements are first published by AEMO under clause 3.6.1(b) and then
at least once in every three-year period from completion of the previous
review.

unavailability of any System Restart Service during a system shutdown or
major supply disruption; and

\(e\) may include any other matters that AEMO determines are necessary
to ensure the SWIS is restarted in the event of a system shutdown or
major supply disruption.

### 3.7.3. AEMO must develop and maintain the System Restart Plan for the
purposes of managing and coordinating restart and restoration of the
SWIS in the event of a system shutdown or major supply disruption.

### 3.7.4. The System Restart Plan must:

\(a\) be consistent with the System Restart Standard;

\(b\) cover the whole of the SWIS but may consist of one or more
separable components; and

\(c\) take into account any Local Black Start Procedures.

### 3.7.5. AEMO must in:

\(a\) developing the System Restart Plan in accordance with clause
### 3.7.3; and

\(b\) making any revisions to the System Restart Plan pursuant to
clauses 3.7.10 or 3.7.11,

> consult in good faith with each Network Operator that AEMO considers
> may be impacted by the System Restart Plan, or the proposed revision
> to it, to assist AEMO to ensure that the System Restart Plan is
> effective and achievable, including in relation to viable restart
> paths.

### 3.7.6. Each Network Operator that may be impacted by the System Restart
Plan must conduct any studies or analyses that are reasonably required
to provide input into the System Restart Plan, within a reasonable
timeframe to be agreed with AEMO.

### 3.7.7. AEMO must, in developing, and making revisions to, the System
Restart Plan, take into account any input provided by a Network Operator
under clause 3.7.6, including any information in relation to:

\(a\) viable restart paths; and

\(b\) following a successful restart, the restoration of any sensitive
Loads on the Network Operator’s Network.

### 3.7.8. Where a Network Operator considers that the conditions on its
Network have changed sufficiently to require changes to the System
Restart Plan, the Network Operator:

\(a\) may request AEMO to review the System Restart Plan; and

\(b\) must, where a request is made by the Network Operator under clause
### 3.7.8(a), provide details of the changes to the conditions on its

useful for the effective operation of the System Restart Plan, AEMO must
provide each Network Operator with the Local Black Start Procedures that
AEMO considers are relevant to the Network Operator.

### 3.7.16. Following a review conducted under clause 3.7.10 or clause
### 3.7.11, AEMO may modify the guidelines for Local Black Start Procedures
by publishing the modified guidelines on the WEM Website, which are
deemed to take effect from the date of publication or later date
notified by AEMO.

### 3.7.17. Following any modification to the guidelines for Local Black
Start Procedures, AEMO may require a Market Participant with a
Registered Facility that is an energy producing system to amend the
Local Black Start Procedures for the Registered Facility. Any such
request by AEMO must:

\(a\) set out the reasons for the requested amendments; and

Essential System Services

### 3.9. Definitions of Essential System Services

### 3.9.1. Regulation is the service, measured in MW, of frequently
adjusting the Injection or Withdrawal of a Facility in accordance with
an AEMO centralised control scheme in order to assist in maintaining the
SWIS Frequency according to the Frequency Operating Standards.

### 3.9.2. Regulation Raise is a Regulation service, measured in MW of
response capability, that operates to raise the SWIS Frequency.

### 3.9.3. Regulation Lower is a Regulation service, measured in MW of
response capability, that operates to lower the SWIS Frequency.

### 3.9.4. Contingency Reserve is the service, measured in MW, of holding
response capability associated with a Facility in reserve so that the
relevant Facility can rapidly adjust Injection or Withdrawal in order to
assist in maintaining the SWIS Frequency according to the Frequency
Operating Standards after a Contingency Event.

### 3.9.5. Contingency Reserve Raise is a Contingency Reserve service,
measured in MW of response capability, that enables a Facility to adjust
Injection or Withdrawal to raise the SWIS Frequency.

### 3.9.6. Contingency Reserve Lower is a Contingency Reserve service,
measured in MW of response capability, that enables a Facility to adjust
Injection or Withdrawal to lower the SWIS Frequency.

### 3.9.7. Rate of Change of Frequency Control Service (“**RoCoF Control
Service**”) is the service, measured in MWs, of providing Inertia which

<th><p><strong>Explanatory Note</strong></p>
<p>The primary objective of the new Non-Co-optimised Essential System
Services (NCESS) framework outlined in the Taskforce Paper: A Framework
for Non-Co-optimised Essential System Service is to enable AEMO and
Western Power to identify and justify the need for an ESS not already
available through existing market mechanisms, and to procure those
services in a transparent and efficient manner.</p>
<p>The NCESS framework outlines:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>the roles of the Coordinator, AEMO and Western Power under the
NCESS framework;</p></li>
<li><p>the conditions associated with power system security and
reliability and market costs that would require Western Power and/or
AEMO to trigger an NCESS procurement process;</p></li>
<li><p>Western Power’s and AEMO’s obligations to consult with the
Coordinator of Energy to seek confirmation to trigger an NCESS
procurement process;</p></li>
<li><p>the procurement process that Western Power and AEMO must follow
to procure NCESS;</p></li>
<li><p>the obligations that NCESS Contract holders must follow;</p></li>
<li><p>the rules for NCESS dispatch and settlement; and</p></li>
<li><p>the obligation for Western Power to prepare a Transmission System
Plan.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>An Interim NCESS Framework will commence on 1 February 2022 and apply
until New WEM Commencement Day. As this Companion Version of the WEM
Rules contains the provisions that will apply from the start of the new
market, please see Schedule B of the Tranche 5 Amendments for the
amendments comprising the interim framework (i.e. sections 3.11A and
### 3.11B) that will apply until that time.</p>
<p>This Framework will replace the concept of Dispatch Support Service
contract with an AEMO-procured NCESS contract (i.e., it is no longer an
Ancillary Service), and a Network Control Service contract with a
Network Operator-procured NCESS Contract.</p>
<p>The intent is that any Dispatch Support Service or Network Control
Service contracts entered into after 1 February 2022 will have the
following obligations applied to them:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>AEMO and Western Power will trigger the procurement of
AEMO-procured and NO-procured NCESS respectively. New clauses for

<p>Clause 3.11A.2 outlines the trigger conditions under which Western
Power or AEMO or both must assess and determine whether to make a
written submission to the Coordinator to trigger the NCESS Procurement
process.</p>
<p>Either entity could form a view that a trigger condition applies, and
it must then make a written submission to the Coordinator. Allowing
either entity to apply to the Coordinator provides a level of guarantee
that at least one entity will seek to trigger, even if the other entity
does not believe the trigger condition applies.</p>
<p>Once a written submission is made to the Coordinator, the Coordinator
may request either or both entities to provide more information or
undertake analysis to assist the Coordinator in deciding whether to
trigger an NCESS procurement process.</p>
<p>Clause 3.11A.2 is amended to improve coordination between AEMO and
Network Operators by requiring a Network Operator to notify AEMO before
the Network Operator makes a submission to request the Coordinator to
determine whether to trigger an NCESS procurement process.</p>
<p>Section 3.11A is expected to be replaced on New WEM Commencement Day
by the <em>Wholesale Electricity Market Amendment (Tranche 5 Amendments)

### 3.11A.2. If AEMO or a Network Operator reasonably considers that one or
more of the following events has occurred or applies:

\(a\) if the forecasted or actual magnitude and frequency of Energy
Uplift Payments in the WEM increases to an uneconomic level (assuming
locational and situational market power is being controlled under the
relevant processes), this indicates a locational constraint in the
network and a case may be made to procure locational services to relieve
the network constraint;

\(b\) frequent AEMO Intervention Events to relieve non-frequency control
constraints such as loss of reactive power or system strength indicates
a network security problem, and a case could be made to procure a
locational security NCESS;

\(c\) if network planning assumptions change at any time during the
network planning timeframe (for example, demand is lower or higher than
forecast), it may signal the need for an emerging service such as
reactive power support or voltage stability which could be provided by
non-network services located in the relevant part of the network;

\(d\) a modification to an existing Power System Security or Power
System Reliability standard or the introduction of a new Power System
Security or Power System Reliability standard within a network planning
cycle may trigger the need to procure a NCESS; or

\(e\) AEMO considers, in the course of its normal power system
operations, that a significant threat to Power System Security or Power
System Reliability exists or is emerging, and the existing mechanisms
under these WEM Rules may not be sufficient to address the threat,

then:

\(f\) AEMO must notify the relevant Network Operator, or the Network
Operator must notify AEMO (as applicable), of each event that AEMO or
the Network Operator (as applicable) considers has occurred or applies,
as soon as practicable but in any event before making a submission under
clause 3.11A.2(g); and

\(g\) AEMO or the relevant Network Operator (or, at their discretion,
both of them) must make a submission (jointly or separately) to request
the Coordinator to determine whether to trigger an NCESS procurement
process in accordance with section 3.11B.

### 3.11A.2A. The Coordinator, in consultation with AEMO and a Network
Operator, must develop, and publish on the WEM Website, a guideline
providing further details regarding the events described in clause
### 3.11A.2.

### 3.11A.3. A submission by a Network Operator or AEMO under clause 3.11A.2
must:

\(a\) be in writing;

\(b\) be made by a date that the Network Operator or AEMO, as
applicable, reasonably considers allows sufficient time to enable the
NCESS procurement process set out in section 3.11B to be conducted; and

\(c\) contain sufficient information and analysis regarding the
potential or actual impact on Power System Security, Power System
Reliability or costs for each trigger event in clause 3.11A.2 that is
specified in the submission to enable the Coordinator to consider the
factors outlined in clause 3.11A.7.

<th><p><strong>Explanatory Note</strong></p>
<p>New section 3.15A sets out the regime for the new SESSM for procuring
FCESS. This new regime replaces the current contract-based
mechanism.</p>
<p>Set out below is an extract from the Taskforce’s Information Paper
<em>Supplementary ESS Procurement Mechanism</em> to provide some
background to the new regime. You should refer to the Information Paper
for further details.</p>
<p>FCESS will be primarily procured via real-time markets, with
participation from all capable and accredited facilities enabled, but
not mandatory. Nevertheless, to protect against the risk of market
failure in what will be relatively small and concentrated markets, the
Taskforce has endorsed the SESSM to provide a means for longer-term
contractual arrangements to increase certainty, mitigate inefficient
market outcomes, support new market entry, and avoid a shortfall in ESS
accreditation and participation. Contrasting with current arrangements,
the SESSM will be implemented through a transparent tender process in
the WEM Rules, rather than through individually negotiated bilateral
contracts.</p>
<p>The broad objectives of the SESSM are to:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>incentivise new FCESS providers to enter the market;</p></li>
<li><p>mitigate scarcity in FCESS markets, manifesting either as a
shortfall of accredited facilities, or shortfall of participation;
and</p></li>
<li><p>mitigation of market power by:</p></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><blockquote>
<p>the threat of competitive entry; and</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote>
<p>a mechanism of ex-ante review of the operating costs of ESS providers
by the Economic Regulation Authority.</p>
</blockquote></li>
</ul>
<p>The procurement of SESSM broadly consists of seven stages:
Triggering, SESSM Service Specification, Veto of Procurement,
Procurement Process, Selection, Veto of Award, and SESSM.</p></th>

### 3.18C. Outage Coordination

### 3.18C.1. For the purposes of this section 3.18C:

\(a\) a Network Operator that submits an Outage Plan that impacts an
Outage Facility (other than a Load) of a Market Participant is an
“Impacting Participant”; and

\(b\) a Market Participant whose Outage Facility (other than a Load) is
impacted by a Network Operator is an “Impacted Participant”,

where "impacts" and "impacted" are determined as per the process
identified in the WEM Procedure in clause 3.18.4.

### 3.18C.2. An Outage Plan that is submitted by an Impacting Participant,
who is aware of an impact, must include:

\(a\) a confirmation by the Impacting Participant that it has notified
the Impacted Participant; and

\(b\) details of the discussions between the Impacting Participant and
Impacted Participants to coordinate the Outage proposed in the Outage
Plan and the outcome of those discussions,

at least 6 months prior to the Outage Commencement Interval.

### 3.18C.3. An Impacted Participant may request AEMO to undertake Outage
coordination where:

\(a\) it reasonably considers that its Outage Facility will be unduly
impacted by an Outage Plan having regard to matters specified in the WEM
Procedure referred to in clause 3.18.4;

\(b\) it has requested the Impacting Participant to vary the Outage
Period or any other component of the Outage Plan in order to minimise
the impact on its Outage Facility; and

\(c\) its request is made in accordance with the process specified in
the WEM Procedure referred to in clause 3.18.4.

### 3.18C.4. Following a request from an Impacted Participant under clause
### 3.18C.3, AEMO must determine, acting reasonably, and in accordance with
the principles specified in clause 3.18C.5 and the WEM Procedure
referred to in clause 3.18.4, whether the Outage Plan submitted by the
Impacting Participant should be revised and the revisions that are
required to be made.

### 3.18C.5. When making a determination under clause 3.18C.4, AEMO must
have regard to the following principles in the following order of
importance:

\(a\) any Power System Security or Power System Reliability implications
if the Outage Plan submitted by the Impacting Participant did not occur
at the Outage Commencement Interval and for the Outage Period requested;

\(b\) whether the Outage Plan submitted by the Impacting Participant was
foreshadowed in the Outage Intention Plan;

\(c\) the notice provided by the Impacting Participant for the Outage
Plan and the timing of the request for Outage coordination by the
Impacted Participant;

\(d\) the technical reasons for the Outage Facility Maintenance, and the
implications for the Outage Facility if the Outage Facility Maintenance
is not commenced at the Outage Commencement Interval requested;

\(e\) any reasons, other than financial implications, provided by the
Impacting Participant in the Outage Plan as to why the Outage Plan could
not be varied as requested by the Impacted Participant;

\(f\) any other principles referred to in clause 3.18C.12(d); and

\(g\) any other information provided by the Impacting Participant or an
Impacted Participant to AEMO as part of the Outage coordination.

### 3.18C.6. AEMO must notify each Impacted Participant and the Impacting
Participant of its determination under clause 3.18C.4 as soon as
practicable.

### 3.18C.7. AEMO may include in the Outage coordination any other Impacted
Participant when undertaking Outage coordination whether or not that
Impacted Participant has requested Outage coordination by AEMO.

### 3.18C.8. In making a determination in respect of the coordination of an
Outage, AEMO must consult, in accordance with any process specified in
the WEM Procedure referred to in clause 3.18.4, with each Impacted
Participant.

### 3.18C.9. A Market Participant and Network Operator must comply with a
determination by AEMO under clause 3.18C.4, and, if required, revise or
withdraw the Outage Plan.

### 3.18C.10. Where AEMO notifies a Market Participant or Network Operator
that an Outage Plan submitted by it is unacceptable, and the Economic
Regulation Authority does not give AEMO a direction under clause
### 3.18F.6(e), then AEMO and the Market Participant or Network Operator
must use best endeavours to agree an alternative time for the relevant
Outage Plan.

AEMO is aware that it should have received a notification under clause
### 3.18D.9 in relation to that Planned Outage; or

\(c\) the relevant Outage Capability is subject to a Forced Outage,

then, AEMO must delay the Outage Evaluation for that Outage Plan until:

\(d\) the relevant Outage Capability is returned to service; or

\(e\) AEMO receives evidence to its satisfaction from the Market
Participant or Network Operator that the relevant Outage Capability
would not be subject to an Outage before the Outage Commencement
Interval in the Outage Plan that is awaiting approval.

### 3.18E.3. AEMO must reject an Outage Plan for an Equipment List Facility
or Self-Scheduling Outage Facility if it is aware that any of the
requirements for an Outage Plan in clause 3.18B.8 have not been met or
complied with.

### 3.18E.5. AEMO must evaluate all Outage Plans for Equipment List
Facilities as required by these WEM Rules by assessing the Outage Plan
against the Outage Evaluation Criteria (“**Outage Evaluation**”). This
evaluation must:

\(a\) be undertaken on Outage Plans in the order in which they are
submitted to AEMO unless AEMO considers it is more efficient or
effective to evaluate Outage Plans out of order;

\(b\) be based on the information available to AEMO at the time the
Outage Evaluation is undertaken;

\(c\) occur when an Outage Plan is received or revised and where
required as part of the PASA studies; and

\(d\) where an Availability Declaration Exemption applies in respect of
Mandatory Routine Maintenance, not result in the Outage Plan being
rejected due to that Mandatory Routine Maintenance not being completed
before the applicable deadline.

### 3.18E.6. In respect of an Outage Evaluation for an Outage Plan of an
Equipment List Facility for Opportunistic Maintenance, AEMO:

\(a\) may reject the Outage Plan if it considers there is inadequate
time to undertake the Outage Evaluation;

\(b\) is deemed to have rejected the Outage Plan 120 minutes before the
Outage Commencement Interval if the Outage Evaluation has not been
completed and the relevant Market Participant or Network Operator has
not been notified of the Outage Evaluation outcome; and otherwise

\(c\) must approve the Outage Plan if it considers the Outage Evaluation
Criteria has been met.

### 3.18E.7. In respect of an Outage Evaluation for an Outage Plan of an
Equipment List Facility that is not for Opportunistic Maintenance, AEMO:

\(a\) must approve or reject each Outage Plan using the Outage
Evaluation Criteria and in accordance with the WEM Procedure referred to
in clause 3.18.4;

\(b\) must not show bias towards a Market Participant or Network
Operator in evaluating the Outage Plan other than as required by the
process for prioritisation set out in the WEM Procedure referred to in
clause 3.18.4;

\(c\) may reject an Outage Plan where the Outage Plan First Submission
Date was less than six weeks before the Outage Commencement Interval
without evaluation if, in its opinion, the submitting party has not
allowed adequate time for the Outage Plan to be assessed;

\(d\) may approve an Outage Plan where the Outage Evaluation Criteria
are met for the Outage Period;

\(e\) may approve an Outage Plan, despite the Outage Evaluation Criteria
