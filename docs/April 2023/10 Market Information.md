### 10.1. Record Retention

### 10.1.1. The Coordinator, the Economic Regulation Authority and Rule
Participants must retain any information or documents that are required
to be collected, produced or exchanged under these WEM Rules or the WEM
Procedures for a period of seven years from the date it is created, or
such longer period as may be required by law.

<th><p><strong>Explanatory Note</strong></p>
<p>Under the revised Market Information framework, neither AEMO nor the
Coordinator will be required to create and maintain a list outlining the
confidentiality status of each type of Market Information. Rather, the
WEM Rules will contain a list of principles that will guide the
classification of Market Information (that is, information required to
be produced, collected or exchanged under the WEM Rules or WEM
Procedures). The WEM Rules will continue to set out which type of
information must be published, and in limited circumstances may specify
that information is public or confidential.</p>
<p>There will only be two categories of Market Information, Public
Information and Confidential Information, and the classes under clause
### 10.2.2 are reduced to reflect this. Instead section 10.4 sets out how
Confidential Information may be disclosed.</p>
<p>It will be the responsibility of the Information Manager (in the
first instance) to determine the status of information. The Information
Manager can only be the Coordinator, the ERA, AEMO or a Network
Operator, and within this framework will either be the party that
collects or the party that produces the Market Information. That party
to whom the Market Information relates (known as the Information
Stakeholder) will be able to provide their view to the Information
Manager to inform the assessment of confidentiality, however it will be
solely up to the Information Manager to make this decision</p>
<p>The Coordinator will be available to resolve any disputes about
confidentiality or to provide advice to the Information Manager if
requested. The WEM Rules will allow for the Coordinator to publish a
procedure with information about assessing confidentiality, as this may
be desirable to improve transparency and consistency in decision making
across different Information Managers.</p>
<p>The intent of the drafting is that the same ‘type’ of information,
(i.e. information submitted under a certain section, clause or
sub-clause of the WEM Rules) maintains the same confidentiality status
over time. It seeks to avoid a type of Market Information being treated
as Confidential Information as it relates to one Rule Participant, but
Public Information as it relates to another Rule Participant, or
differently over time.</p></th>

### 10.2.1. Subject to clause 10.2.1B, an Information Manager must, in
accordance with the WEM Rules and WEM Procedures, determine the
confidentiality status for each type of Market Information it is
responsible for under clause 10.2.12.

### 10.2.1A. No confidentiality status will be given to information,
documents or data disclosed to the Coordinator, the Economic Regulation
Authority, AEMO or a Network Operator if that information, documents or
data is not Market Information.

### 10.2.1B. An Information Manager is not required to determine the
confidentiality status of a type of Market Information for which it is
responsible if the Information Manager:

\(a\) has not been requested to disclose the type of Market Information
to any requesting party under section 10.4;

\(b\) is not required to disclose the type of Market Information to any
other party under these WEM Rules or a WEM Procedure; and

\(c\) treats the type of Market Information as Confidential Information
for the purposes of clauses 10.2.9 and 10.4.2.

### 10.2.2. The classes of confidentiality status are:

\(a\) Public Information, in which case the Market Information may be
made available to any person by any person; and

\(b\) Confidential Information, in which case the Market Information may
only be disclosed in accordance with clauses 10.4.4 and 10.4.19, or as
otherwise required under these WEM Rules and the WEM Procedures.

### 10.2.3. Subject to clause 10.2.5, an Information Manager must classify
Market Information as Confidential Information if:

\(a\) the Information Manager is not required to classify the Market
Information as Public Information under clause 10.2.4; and

\(b\) the Market Information:

i\. is contained in a contract to which the Rule Participant is a
counterparty, but only insofar as the Market Information is specified in
the contract as being confidential under the contract;

ii\. could, in the reasonable opinion of the Information Manager, pose a
material risk to Power System Security or Power System Reliability if
disclosed;

iii\. reveals personal details about an individual, but excluding their
name and business contact details (including company name and address
details, position, telephone numbers, mobile numbers and email
addresses) that forms part of Market Information that is not
confidential;

iv\. could, in the reasonable opinion of the Information Manager (or
Coordinator in the case of a dispute under section 10.5), cause
commercial detriment to a Rule Participant or another person if
disclosed; or

v\. is otherwise specified as Confidential Information under these WEM
Rules.

### 10.2.4. Market Information must be classified as Public Information if
it is:

\(a\) specified as Public Information under these WEM Rules;

\(b\) required to be published or otherwise made publicly available
under these WEM Rules; or

\(c\) available in the public domain, other than by reason of a breach
of these WEM Rules or by any other unlawful means.

### 10.2.5. Clause 10.2.3 does not prevent the disclosure or publication of
Market Information if it is aggregated, arranged or combined with other
data or information such that it does not reveal any Confidential
Information. Market Information that is aggregated, arranged or combined
with other data or information such that it does not reveal any
Confidential Information is deemed to be Market Information that is
classified as Public Information.

### 10.2.6. Without limiting clause 10.2.4, an Information Manager must
classify Market Information as Public Information if the Information
Manager does not consider that the Market Information is required to be
classified as Confidential Information under clause 10.2.3.

### 10.2.7. A Rule Participant may make a submission to an Information
Manager about Market Information that the Rule Participant considers to
be Confidential Information if:

\(a\) the Rule Participant is an Information Stakeholder for the Market
Information; and

\(b\) the confidentiality status of the Market Information is not
required to be Public Information under clause 10.2.4.

A submission must include the Rule Participant’s reasoning for
classifying the Market Information as Confidential Information against
the criteria in clause 10.2.3.

### 10.2.7A. A Rule Participant is an Information Stakeholder for Market
Information if:

\(a\) the Market Information explicitly relates to the Rule Participant
or its Facilities, activities or contractual arrangements;

\(b\) where clause 10.2.7A(a) does not apply, the Rule Participant or
its Facilities, activities or contractual arrangements would otherwise
be able to be identified from the Market Information; or

\(c\) the Market Information relates to information, data or documents
that a third party provided to the Rule Participant and the Rule
Participant is under a duty or obligation (however described) to that
third party to keep the relevant information, data or documents
confidential.

### 10.2.8. A submission from a Rule Participant made under clause 10.2.7
must be considered by the Information Manager (or the Coordinator in the
case of a dispute under section 10.5) when classifying Market
Information. However the Information Manager (or Coordinator in the case
of a dispute under section 10.5) will not be bound by any submission
made by a Rule Participant in making its determination.

### 10.2.9. Subject to clauses 10.4.4 and 10.4.19, and unless otherwise
required or permitted by these WEM Rules, the Coordinator, the Economic
Regulation Authority and Rule Participants must not disclose
Confidential Information to any person.

### 10.2.10. The Coordinator may document in a WEM Procedure guidance for
Information Managers to assist with determining the confidentiality
status of Market Information in accordance with clause 10.2.3.

<th><p><strong>Explanatory Note</strong></p>
<p>The intent is that the Information Manager is the party that Market
Information is delivered to in the first instance. It is expected that
in the majority of cases that this will be AEMO but that in any case it
can only be AEMO, a Network Operator, the Coordinator or the ERA – i.e.
a Market Participant cannot be an Information Manager.</p>
<p>Given that Market Information is not always delivered to a party
(i.e. sometimes AEMO or Western Power may produce their own Market
Information), clause 10.2.12 sets out a hierarchy to guide Rule
Participants and other interested parties on who the Information Manager
for a particular type of Market Information is (as there cannot be two
Information Managers for one type of Market Information). Given that
circumstances may arise where it is unclear which party should take
responsibility, clause 10.2.12(c) allows the Coordinator of Energy to
make a determination on who the Information Manager is.</p></th>

### 10.2.11. Only one party may be the Information Manager for a type of
Market Information, and the Information Manager may only be the
Coordinator, the Economic Regulation Authority, AEMO or a Network
Operator.

### 10.2.12. Subject to clause 10.2.11, the Information Manager for a type
of Market Information is:

\(a\) in the first instance, the party who is required to publish the
Market Information in accordance with these WEM Rules or the WEM
Procedures;

\(b\) if clause 10.2.12(a) does not apply, then the party who produces
the Market Information in accordance with these WEM Rules or the WEM
Procedures;

\(c\) if neither of clauses 10.2.12(a) or 10.2.12(b) apply, then the
party who receives the Market Information under these WEM Rules or the
WEM Procedures; or

\(d\) if none of clauses 10.2.12(a), 10.2.12(b) or 10.2.12(c) apply, or
it is unclear who the Information Manager is under clauses 10.2.12(a),
### 10.2.12(b) and 10.2.12(c), then the Coordinator may determine the
Information Manager.

Regulation Authority, AEMO or a Network Operator must not require a fee
for Market Information required to be disclosed or published by the
Coordinator, the Economic Regulation Authority, AEMO or the Network
Operator in accordance with these WEM Rules or the WEM Procedures.

### 10.3.3. Subject to clause 10.3.4, Market Information required to be
published must, where practical, be maintained on an Information
Manager’s website for as long as that Market Information is required to
be retained in accordance with clause 10.1.1.

### 10.3.4. If the Information Manager determines that it is no longer
practical or efficient to maintain Market Information on a website in
accordance with clause 10.3.3, the Information Manager must retain the
Market Information as required by clause 10.1.1 and make the Market
Information available at no cost to any person on application.

### 10.4. Managing Market Information

### 10.4.1. The Coordinator, the Economic Regulation Authority and each Rule
Participant must:

\(a\) manage Market Information in accordance with this section 10.4;

\(b\) take all reasonable measures to protect any Confidential
Information that is in its possession from unauthorised use or
disclosure; and

\(c\) if it is made aware that the Confidential Information has come
into its possession erroneously, take reasonable steps to destroy that
Confidential Information.

### 10.4.2. The Coordinator, the Economic Regulation Authority, AEMO and
each Network Operator may only use Confidential Information in its
possession to the extent that it considers it is required to perform its
functions under sections 2.1A, 2.2A, 2.2C or 2.2D, as applicable.

### 10.4.3. Clause 10.4.1(b) does not prevent the disclosure of information
by the Coordinator, the Economic Regulation Authority or a Rule
Participant (“**disclosing party**”) to:

\(a\) an employee or officer of the disclosing party, or a related body
corporate of the disclosing party; or

\(b\) a legal or other professional adviser, auditor or other consultant
of the disclosing party, who requires the Market Information in relation
to the performance of the disclosing party's functions or obligations
under these WEM Rules, or for the purpose of advising the disclosing
party in respect of these functions or obligations,

provided that the disclosing party ensures that these persons are under
equivalent obligations of confidence to the disclosing party as those
provided in these WEM Rules.
