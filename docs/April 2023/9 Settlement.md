<th><p><strong>Explanatory Note</strong></p>
<p>Clause 9.1.1 is added to reflect that the Network Operator is a party
to settlement for RoCoF cost recovery and therefore the term Market
Participant is not appropriate in that case. 9.1.1 removes AEMO from the
definition of Rule Participant for Chapter 9 so AEMO is not
inadvertently captured in settlement equations.</p></th>

9.1.1. In this Chapter 9, apart from clause 9.1.3 (where Rule
Participant has its ordinary meaning), a reference to "Rule Participant"
is a reference to the relevant Market Participant or the relevant
Network Operator as the case may be (and is not a reference to any other
Rule Participant).

9.1.2. Settlement is to be based on whole Trading Days, though partial
Trading Days are to be facilitated on the first and last day of a
financial year and at the commencement of the market. For this purpose,
AEMO may declare that part of a Trading Day is to be treated as if that
part was a full Trading Day by notice published on the WEM Website.

9.1.3. With respect to the treatment of GST:

\(a\) all prices, fees and other charges under these WEM Rules (other
than under this clause 9.1.3) are exclusive of GST;

\(b\) in this clause 9.1.3, “adjustment notes”, “GST group”, “input tax
credit”, “member”, “recipient created tax invoice”, “representative
member”, “supply”, “tax invoice”, “taxable supply” and “valid tax
invoice” each have the meaning given to the relevant term in the GST
Act;

\(c\) where a Rule Participant makes a taxable supply to another Rule
Participant or person under these WEM Rules, the other Rule Participant
or person must also pay the first Rule Participant making the supply an
additional amount equal to the GST payable in respect of that supply;

\(d\) AEMO must include in Settlement Statements and Invoices issued
under these WEM Rules the additional amounts contemplated by clause
9.1.3(c);

\(e\) Rule Participants must, if requested by AEMO, do everything
necessary (including entering into recipient created tax invoice
agreements) to enable AEMO to issue valid tax invoices, recipient
created tax invoices and adjustment notes in respect of all taxable
supplies made by or to AEMO under these WEM Rules;

\(f\) however, if the additional amount paid or payable to AEMO or a
Rule Participant or another person under this clause 9.1.3 in respect of
a taxable supply differs from the actual amount of GST payable by the
Rule Participant under the GST Act in respect of the relevant supply,
then adjustments must be made under clause 9.15 so as to ensure the
additional amount paid under this clause in respect of the supply is
equal to the actual amount of GST payable under the GST Act in respect
of the supply; and

\(g\) if AEMO determines that:

i\. a party is entitled to payment of any costs or expenses by way of
reimbursement or indemnity; or

ii\. a price, fee or other charge payable under these WEM Rules (other
than Market Participant Regulator Fees and Market Participant
Coordinator Fees) is calculated with reference to a cost or expense
incurred by a party,

then the payment or cost or expense (as the case may be) must exclude
any part of the cost or expense which is attributable to GST for which
the party (or a representative member of any GST group of which the
party is a member) is entitled to an input tax credit.

9.1.4. Where these WEM Rules indicate interest is payable on an amount,
interest accrues daily at the Bank Bill Rate from (and including) the
date that payment was due up to (but excluding) the date of payment, or
in the case of an adjusted Settlement Statement provided under clause
9.15 from (and including) the payment due date for the Invoice issued
for the original Settlement Statement up to (but excluding) the actual
date of payment for the Invoice issued for the adjusted Settlement
Statement.

9.1.5. Except where otherwise stated, AEMO will perform all calculations
described in this chapter.

new framework. However, the Non-Dispatchable Load associated with an
Intermittent Load or a DSP will have a Metered Schedule so that the
consumption is not included in the Notional Wholesale Meter.</p>
<p>The definition of "Non-Dispatchable Load" is also updated.</p>
<p>Further consideration is intended to be given to small DER

9.5.1. For each Trading Interval AEMO must determine the Metered
Schedule in accordance with clause 9.5.2 for each:

\(a\) Scheduled Facility;

\(b\) Semi–Scheduled Facility;

\(c\) Non-Scheduled Facility; and

\(d\) Non-Dispatchable Load.

9.5.2. Subject to clauses 2.30B.10 and 2.30B.11, the Metered Schedule
for a Trading Interval for each:

\(a\) Scheduled Facility;

\(b\) Semi-Scheduled Facility;

\(c\) Non-Scheduled Facility; and

\(d\) Non-Dispatchable Load, excluding Non-Dispatchable Loads referred
to in clause 9.5.3,

is the net quantity of energy generated and sent out into the relevant
Network or consumed by the Facility during that Trading Interval, Loss
Factor adjusted to the Reference Node, and determined from Meter Data
Submissions received by AEMO in accordance with section 8.4 or SCADA
data maintained by AEMO in accordance with clause 7.13.1E(a)(i) where
interval meter data is not available.

9.5.3. AEMO must determine a single Metered Schedule for a Trading
Interval for those Non-Dispatchable Loads without interval meters or
with meters not read as interval meters that are served by Synergy
where:

\(a\) the Metered Schedule equals the Notional Wholesale Meter value for
that Trading Interval;

\(b\) the Notional Wholesale Meter value for a Trading Interval equals
negative one multiplied by:

i\. the sum of the Metered Schedules with positive quantities for that
Trading Interval; plus

ii\. the sum of the Metered Schedules with negative quantities for that
Trading Interval,

where the Metered Schedules referred to in clauses 9.5.3(b)(i) and
9.5.3(b)(ii) exclude the Metered Schedule for the Notional Wholesale
Meter.

9.5.4. AEMO must determine the Demand Side Programme Load for a Demand
Side Programme for a Trading Interval as the total net MWh quantity of
energy consumed by the Associated Loads of that Demand Side Programme
during the Trading Interval, determined from Meter Data Submissions and

is taken from the relevant payment calculation clause, so that it is
adjusted accordingly where the Registered Facility is subject to an

<p>For an eligible Registered Facility, the Enablement Losses are the
difference between its marginal energy offer price and the market

9.15. Adjustment Process

9.15.1. When undertaking an Adjustment Process AEMO must:

\(a\) recalculate the amounts included in the Relevant Settlement
Statements in accordance with this Chapter 9 but taking into account
any:

i\. revised meter data which has been provided by Metering Data Agents;

ii\. actions arising from a Notice of Disagreement;

iii\. resolution of a Notice of Dispute;

iv\. revised Market Participant Market Fee rate or Market Participant
Regulator Fee rate;

v\. adjustment required for GST purposes under clause 9.1.3;

vi\. revised value that AEMO reasonably considers to be in compliance
with these WEM Rules and accurate; and

vii\. other relevant value that has been revised in accordance with the
WEM Rules; and

\(b\) provide adjusted Settlement Statements to Rule Participants for
Relevant Settlement Statements on the Relevant Settlement Adjustment
Date.

9.15.2. Where AEMO decides that it will use a revised value, as
contemplated under clause 9.15.1(a)(vi), in the final adjusted
Settlement Statement (to be issued on Settlement Adjustment Date 3 for a
Trading Week), AEMO must, as soon as practicable, notify the relevant
Rule Participant of the proposed revised value and the reason for its
decision.

9.15.3. Subject to clause 9.15.4, an adjusted Settlement Statement must
be in the same form as the original Settlement Statement, but where data
is modified between the issuance of the original Settlement Statement
and the adjusted Settlement Statement, AEMO must record adjusted
settlement values in the adjusted Settlement Statement and provide an
explanation of any changes on request.

9.15.4. An adjusted Settlement Statement must include details of the
adjustment to be paid by or to the Rule Participant, being:

\(a\) the adjustment which will need to be paid by or to the Rule
Participant to put the Rule Participant in the position it would have
been in at the time payment was made in respect of the original
Settlement Statement if the adjusted Settlement Statement had been
issued as the original Settlement Statement (but taking into account any
adjustments previously made under this section 9.15); plus

\(b\) interest on the amount referred to in clause 9.15.4(a) calculated
in accordance with clause 9.1.4.

9.15.5. In recalculating amounts as part of an Adjustment Process, AEMO
may use the version of the settlement calculation software current at
the time of the recalculation.

9.15.6. At the same time as AEMO provides a Rule Participant with an
adjusted Settlement Statement under clause 9.15.1(b), it must also
provide that Rule Participant with an Invoice reflecting the adjusted
Settlement Statement and the amounts referred to in clause 9.15.4.

9.15.7. The Settlement Date for a Settlement Statement issued under
clause 9.15.1(b) is the date upon which transactions covered by that
Settlement Statement are settled and must be no later than the second
Business Day following the date of issue of the Invoice described in
clause 9.15.6.

9.15.8. If, for an Adjustment Process, the Service Fee Settlement Amount
payable to AEMO under clause 9.13.2 based on the adjusted Market
Participant Market Fees settlement amount is less than the Service Fee
Settlement Amount payable to AEMO under clause 9.13.2 for the last
Settlement Statement for that period, AEMO must make available the
shortfall amount from the fund established under clause 9.18.9 for the
purpose of meeting AEMO’s obligations under clause 9.18.8.

9.15.9. AEMO and the Economic Regulation Authority must agree and
implement an arrangement to apply for any Adjustment Process where the
Service Fee Settlement Amount payable to the Economic Regulation
Authority under clause 9.13.3 based on the adjusted Market Participant
Regulator Fees settlement amount is less than the Service Fee Settlement
Amount payable to the Economic Regulation Authority under clause 9.13.3
for the last Settlement Statement for that period. The arrangement must
require:

\(a\) the Economic Regulation Authority to return the shortfall amount
to AEMO by 10:00 AM on the relevant Settlement Date; and

\(b\) AEMO, if the Economic Regulation Authority fails to provide the
shortfall amount to AEMO by 10:00 AM on the relevant Settlement Date, to
make available the shortfall amount from the fund established under
clause 9.18.9 for the purpose of meeting AEMO’s obligations under clause
9.18.8.

9.15.10. AEMO and the Coordinator must agree and implement an
arrangement to apply for any Adjustment Process where the Service Fee
Settlement Amount payable to the Coordinator under clause 9.13.4 based
on the adjusted Market Participant Coordinator Fees settlement amount is
less than the Service Fee Settlement Amount payable to the Coordinator
under clause 9.13.4 for the last Settlement Statement for that period.
The arrangement must require:

\(a\) the Coordinator to return the shortfall amount to AEMO by 10:00 AM
on the relevant Settlement Date; and

\(b\) AEMO, if the Coordinator fails to provide the shortfall amount to
AEMO by 10:00 AM on the relevant Settlement Date, to make available the
shortfall amount from the fund established under clause 9.18.9 for the
purpose of meeting AEMO’s obligations under clause 9.18.8.

Participant must comply with a request under this clause 9.16.6.

9.16.7. If a Notice of Disagreement relates to information provided to

with these WEM Rules and accurate; or

\(b\) if the information relates to values that are outputs to the
settlement process AEMO must review its settlement calculations and
assess whether any errors were made.

9.16.9. AEMO must, as soon as practicable, but within 20 Business Days

Amount**”); and

\(b\) If AEMO is not able to recover all or part of the Repaid Amount by
drawing upon Credit Support held by AEMO in relation to the Rule
Participant, then AEMO must raise a Repaid Amount Levy from all Market
Participants (other than from Market Participants with unrecovered
Payment Defaults) to recover the remainder of the Repaid Amount. AEMO
will determine the amount to be paid by each Market Participant, having
regard to the absolute value of the MWh of generation or consumption,
determined in accordance with the Metered Schedules, for each Market
Participant for Trading Intervals during the most recent Trading Week
for which Settlement Statements have been issued, as a proportion of the
total of those values for all Market Participants (other than Market
Participants with unrecovered Payment Defaults).

required to be paid.

9.20.2C. By the end of the second month following the end of a Financial
Year, AEMO must re-allocate any Repaid Amount Levies raised during that
Financial Year as follows:

\(a\) AEMO will determine the sum of the Repaid Amount Levies raised by
AEMO during the Financial Year;

\(b\) AEMO will determine the aggregate Repaid Amount Levy amount which
should have been paid by each Market Participant, having regard to the

9.20.3. Notwithstanding anything else in these WEM Rules, if at any time
the total amount received by AEMO from Rule Participants in cleared
funds, including any payments from AEMO on behalf of the Economic
Regulation Authority under clause 9.15.8 and the Coordinator under
clause 9.15.9 (“**Total Amount**”) is not sufficient to make the

9.20.4. AEMO must apply the Total Amount as follows.

\(a\) First, AEMO must apply the Total Amount to satisfy:

i\. payment of Service Fee Settlement Amounts to AEMO, the Economic
Regulation Authority and the Coordinator (including as contemplated by
clause 9.18.10); and

ii\. payments which AEMO is required to make under Supplementary
Capacity Contracts or to a provider of a System Restart Contract with
AEMO, up to a maximum for any party of the net amount which, if
sufficient funds were available, would be payable to that party,

but if the Total Amount is not sufficient to satisfy all of these
payments then AEMO must reduce the payments proportionally. Each payment
will be based on the proportion that the Total Amount bears to the
amount that would have been required to make all payments.

\(b\) Second, AEMO must apply the remainder to pay the net amounts
(after the application of clause 9.20.4(a)) which, if sufficient funds
were available, it would owe to Rule Participants in accordance with
clause 9.18, where those amounts are reduced by applying the following
formula:

> AAP = (NAP / TNAP) × MAA
>
> where:

i\. AAP is the reduced amount actually payable by AEMO to a Rule
Participant in respect of the relevant Trading Week;

ii\. NAP is the net amount that would have been payable by AEMO to the
Rule Participant (after the application of clause 9.20.4(a)) but for the
application of this clause 9.20.4(b), in respect of the relevant Trading
Week;

iii\. TNAP is the total net amount payable by AEMO to all Rule
Participants (after the application of clause 9.20.4(a)) but for the
application of this clause 9.20.4(b), in respect of the relevant Trading
Week, calculated by summing all values of NAP; and

iv\. MAA is the remainder of the Total Amount available for payment by
AEMO after the application of clause 9.20.4(a).

9.20.5. If AEMO has reduced any payment under clause 9.20.4 as a result
of a Payment Default and, within five Business Days of the Payment
Default, it has received full or partial payment of the overdue amount,
then AEMO must within one Business Day apply the amount received
(including any interest paid under clause 9.18.7 in respect of the
Payment Default) as follows.

\(a\) First, AEMO must apply the amount received to pay parties who
suffered a reduction under clause 9.20.4(a). The amount payable by AEMO
to each party is equal to the amount by which that party’s payment was
originally reduced under clause 9.20.4(a), adjusted to reflect interest
accrued in accordance with clause 9.1.3 and any payments already made
under this clause 9.20.5. However, if the amount received by AEMO is
less than the total amount payable to these parties then AEMO must
reduce the payments proportionally. Each payment will be based on the
proportion that the amount received by AEMO bears to the total amount
payable under this clause 9.20.5(a).

\(b\) Second, AEMO must apply the remainder on a pro-rata basis to all
Rule Participants who suffered a reduction under clause 9.20.4(b). The
amount to be paid to each relevant Rule Participant is determined by
applying the formula in clause 9.20.4(b), but as if:

i\. AAP referred to the amount to be paid to each relevant Rule
Participant;

ii\. MAA referred to the remainder of the full or partial payment after
the application of clause 9.20.5(a); and

iii\. NAP and TNAP have the same values as when the reduction was
calculated.

9.20.6. If, five Business Days after a Payment Default, AEMO is yet to
recover in full the overdue amount, then it must raise a Default Levy
from all Market Participants (other than from Market Participants with
unrecovered Payment Defaults) to cover the remaining shortfall
(including interest calculated in accordance with clause 9.18.7). AEMO
will determine the amount to be paid by each Market Participant, having
regard to the absolute value of the MWh of generation or consumption,
determined in accordance with the Metered Schedules, for each Market
Participant for Trading Intervals during the most recent Trading Week
for which Settlement Statements have been issued, as a proportion of the
total of those values for all Market Participants (other than Market
Participants with unrecovered Payment Defaults).

9.20.7. AEMO must notify each relevant Market Participant of the amount
it must pay in respect of the Default Levy as determined in accordance
with clause 9.20.6 within six Business Days of the Payment Default
occurring.

9.20.8. A Market Participant must pay the full amount notified by AEMO
under clause 9.20.7 to AEMO (in cleared funds) by 10:00 AM of the eighth
Business Day following the date of the Payment Default, whether or not
it disputes the amount notified.

9.20.9. By 2:00 PM on the eighth Business Day following the date of a
Payment Default, AEMO is to allocate the total of the Default Levy
amounts received under clause 9.20.8 as follows.

\(a\) First, AEMO must apply the total amount received to pay parties
who suffered a reduction under clause 9.20.4(a). The amount payable by
AEMO to each party is equal to the amount by which that party’s payment
was originally reduced under clause 9.20.4(a), adjusted to reflect
interest accrued in accordance with clause 9.1.4 and any payments
already made under clause 9.20.5 or this clause 9.20.9. However, if the
amount received by AEMO is less than the total amount payable to these
parties then AEMO must reduce the payments proportionally. Each payment
will be based on the proportion that the total amount received by AEMO
bears to the total amount that would have been required to make all
payments under this clause 9.20.9(a).

\(b\) Second, AEMO must apply the remainder on a pro-rata basis to all
Rule Participants who suffered a reduction under clause 9.20.4(b). The
amount to be paid to each relevant Rule Participant is determined by
applying the formula in clause 9.20.4(b), but as if:

i\. AAP referred to the amount to be paid to each relevant Rule
Participant;

ii\. MAA referred to the remainder of the total of the Default Levy
amounts received under clause 9.20.8 after the application of clause
9.20.9(a); and

iii\. NAP and TNAP have the same values as when the reduction was
calculated.

9.20.10. If a Market Participant pays part or all of a Default Levy

9.20.11. By the end of the second month following the end of a Financial
Year, AEMO must re-allocate any Default Levies raised during that
Financial Year as follows:

\(a\) AEMO will determine the aggregate of the shortfalls in respect of
which it raised Default Levies during the Financial Year less any
subsequent amounts recovered and refunded under clause 9.20.12;

\(b\) AEMO will determine the aggregate Default Levy amount which should
have been paid by each Market Participant, having regard to the absolute
value of the MWh of generation or consumption, as determined in
accordance with the Metered Schedules for each Market Participant
(excluding Market Participants with unrecovered Payment Defaults) for
Trading Intervals during the Financial Year as a proportion of the total
of those values for all these Market Participants;

\(c\) AEMO must compare the amount determined for the Market Participant
under clause 9.20.11(b) with the total of the amounts which the Market
Participant actually paid under clause 9.20.8;

\(d\) AEMO must determine an appropriate adjustment to put each Market
Participant in the position it would have been in had it paid the amount
determined under clause 9.20.11(b) instead of the amounts actually paid
under clause 9.20.8; and

\(e\) AEMO must include that adjustment in the Settlement Statement for
the most recently completed Trading Week.

9.20.12. If, after raising a Default Levy in respect of a Payment
Default in accordance with clause 9.20.6, AEMO recovers all or part of
the relevant shortfall from the defaulting Rule Participant, then it
must use the amount recovered to refund Default Levy amounts paid under
clause 9.20.8 in respect of the Payment Default as soon as practicable
but not later than the end of the calendar month following the month in
which the amount is recovered. AEMO will determine the amount to be
refunded to each Market Participant which paid a Default Levy amount
under clause 9.20.8 in respect of the Payment Default (as adjusted, if
applicable, under clause 9.20.11). In determining the amount to be
refunded to a Market Participant, AEMO must have regard to:

\(a\) the amount recovered; and

\(b\) the Default Levy amount paid by the Market Participant under
clause 9.20.8 (as adjusted, if applicable, under clause 9.20.11) as a
proportion of the total of those amounts paid by all Market
Participants.
