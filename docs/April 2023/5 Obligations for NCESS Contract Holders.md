<th><p><strong>Explanatory Note</strong></p>
<p>Any existing or new facility or equipment whether belonging to
registered or intending market participants is able to participate in an
NCESS procurement.</p>
<p>Existing market participants will only be compensated for costs not
already covered through participation in the existing mechanisms of the
WEM. For example, where a facility has already been granted or will
receive capacity credits, the facility will only be compensated for any
incremental fixed costs incurred in providing NCESS. Where a facility is
granted an NCESS contract within a capacity year and the allocation of
certified reserve capacity has already taken place, the facility will be
required to apply for certified reserve capacity in the Reserve Capacity
Cycle following immediately after the year in which the NCESS contract
was granted.</p>
<p>New participants may submit both their fixed and operating costs and
will be required to declare in their submissions whether or not the
facility has applied for or has been granted capacity credits in respect
of the capacity that will provide the NCESS.</p>
<p>Only Facility Technology Types that would ordinarily be capable of
receiving certified reserve capacity under chapter-4 are required to
apply in the Reserve Capacity Cycle. Where a facility or equipment would
not ordinarily be eligible for certified reserve capacity under Chapter-
4 (for e.g. a static var compensator), the relevant market participant
will not be required to participate in the RCM. Instead, it will be
required to declare in its submission why it is ineligible to receive
capacity.</p></th>

5.2A Registration and Certification

<tr class="header">
<th><p><strong>Explanatory Note</strong></p>
<p>Clauses 5.2A.2 and 5.2A.3 require a Market Participant to apply for
Certified Reserve Capacity if it has entered into a Network Control
Service Contract or Dispatch Support Service Contract prior to the close
of the Certified Reserve Capacity application window. Clause 4.8A.3
requires a Market Participant to apply for an indicative Facility Class
prior to submitting an application for Certified Reserve Capacity.</p>
<p>If a Market Participant enters into a contract a short period (e.g. a
day or even a week) before the certification application window closes,
it would have a rule obligation to apply for Certified Reserve Capacity.
However, this would not provide AEMO with sufficient time to assign the
Facility an indicative Facility Class and create a Certified Reserve
Capacity application in its systems to enable the Market Participant to
submit an application before the certification window closes. This would
force either AEMO or the Market Participant into non-compliance.</p>
<p>To resolve this issue, clause 5.2A.3 is amended to shift the relevant
deadline to the opening of the certification application window (as
specified under clause 4.1.7).</p></th>

5.2A.2 Where a Market Participant enters into an NCESS Contract for a
Facility, and the Facility Technology Type for the Facility would
ordinarily be capable of being assigned Certified Reserve Capacity, then
the Market Participant must apply to AEMO for Certified Reserve
Capacity, must meet the requirements of clause 4.8A.3(c) where
applicable, and use best endeavours to meet the requirements of clause
4.10.1, in respect of the Facility, in respect of each Reserve Capacity
Cycle that the Facility would be eligible to participate in over the
period of the NCESS Contract.

<p>The amendment to clause 5.2A.3 to shift the deadline specified in the
clause to the opening of the certification application window will need
to be remade following the replacement of that clause by the
<em>Wholesale Electricity Market Amendment (Tranche 5 Amendments) Rules
2021</em> (Schedule I, paragraph 37.2). See also the Explanatory Note

5.2A.3. Clause 5.2A.2 does not require a Market Participant to apply for
Certified Reserve Capacity for a Facility for a Reserve Capacity Cycle
where the Market Participant has entered into an NCESS Contract in
respect of the Facility after the date and time specified under clause
4.1.7 for that relevant Reserve Capacity Cycle.

5.3. Variations to NCESS Contract

5.3.1. Where a Market Participant, that has entered into an NCESS
Contract in respect of a Facility, is assigned Capacity Credits for the
Facility in a Reserve Capacity Cycle that coincides with the period of
the NCESS Contract, then:

\(a\) where the NCESS Contract was entered into with AEMO, AEMO must
vary the payment terms of the NCESS Contract such that the total payment
under the NCESS Contract is reduced by the value of the total amount of
the expected Capacity Credit payments to be paid to the relevant Market
Participant for that Reserve Capacity Cycle; or

\(b\) where the NCESS Contract was entered into with a Network Operator,
AEMO must provide the value of the total amount of expected Capacity
Credit payments to the Network Operator, and the Network Operator must
vary the payment terms of the NCESS Contract such that the total payment
under the NCESS Contract is reduced by the value of the total amount of
the expected Capacity Credit payments to be paid to the relevant Market
Participant for that Reserve Capacity Cycle.

5.3.2. Where the NCESS Contract payment terms are varied in accordance
with clause 5.3.1(a), AEMO must apply the revised payment terms in the
immediate next Settlement Statement.

5.3A Information required from the Network Operator

5.3A.1. When a Network Operator has entered into an NCESS Contract with
a Market Participant, the Network Operator must as soon as practicable
and not less than 20 Business Days prior to the NCESS Contract taking
effect, provide AEMO with:

\(a\) the identity of the Market Participant or the service provider
that intends to become registered as a Rule Participant in the Market
Participant class;

\(b\) the identity of the facility or equipment providing the NCESS;

\(c\) a unique identifier for the NCESS Contract;

\(d\) the period over which the NCESS is to be provided by the NCESS
Contract;

\(e\) where applicable, the arrangements for scheduling and dispatch of
the Facility or equipment to enable or dispatch the NCESS; and

\(f\) unless AEMO has already been provided with a copy of the final
NCESS Contract pursuant to clause 3.11B.13, a copy of the signed NCESS
Contract.

5.3A.2 When any change occurs to the details of an NCESS listed in
clause 5.3A.1 the Network Operator must inform AEMO as soon as
practicable.

5.5. \[Blank\]

5.6. \[Blank\]

5.7. NCESS Dispatch

5.7.1. \[Blank\]

5.7.2. AEMO may call upon the relevant facility or equipment to provide
the NCESS under a NCESS Contract in accordance with the terms of the
contract, or as advised to it by the Network Operator in accordance with
clause 5.3A.1, whether or not AEMO is a counterparty to the NCESS
Contract.

5.7.3. Where applicable, AEMO must formulate Constraint Equations in
accordance with the WEM Procedure referred to in clause 2.27A.10(c) to
reflect the terms of the NCESS Contract for use in the Dispatch
Algorithm.

5.7.4. Where the terms of an NCESS Contract cannot be expressed as a
Constraint Equation, AEMO must record the following details of any
instruction to the Facility or equipment in respect of the provisions of
the NCESS:

\(a\) the date, time and duration of the instruction;

\(b\) the nature of the instruction;

\(c\) the type of NCESS instructed to be provided;

system for each NCESS Contract for each Dispatch Interval in a Trading
Week:

\(a\) the Market Participant that has entered into the NCESS Contract;

\(b\) the set of Registered Facilities providing services under the
NCESS Contract whose EOI Quantity is higher than it otherwise would have
been as a result of a binding Constraint Equation applied under clause
7.2.4(iA) relating to the NCESS Contract; and

\(c\) the payment to be made by AEMO for services provided under the
NCESS Contract.

5.9.2. AEMO must provide Network Operators with details of any
quantities dispatched or otherwise instructed by AEMO to be provided

i\. the information recorded by AEMO for each Dispatch Instruction under
clause 7.6.8;

ii\. the unique identifier for each relevant Constraint Equation that
bound in the Dispatch Interval;

\(d\) insofar as the terms of the NCESS Contract cannot be expressed in

<th><p><strong>Explanatory Note</strong></p>
<p>Chapter 6 is to be renamed ‘The Short Term Energy Market’ and will be
limited to matters relating only to the Short Term Energy Market
(<strong>STEM</strong>).</p>
<p>The STEM is a financially binding day-ahead market. STEM provides a
centrally coordinated opportunity for Market Participants to trade
around their bilateral positions, supplementing and complementing the
off-market bilateral contracts regime. It allows for financial trading
against contract positions, rather than centralised scheduling and
commitment, though it does provide a firm financial basis for commitment
of long-start-time Registered Facilities.</p>
<p>The changes focus on four main aspects:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>removing narrow windows and timings for AEMO and Market
Participants to submit information, in favour of continuously updated
information from AEMO, and flexibility for Market Participants to submit
information at their convenience;</p></li>
<li><p>Market Participants will now use data from the Pre-Dispatch
Schedules to bound their STEM submissions, replacing the current
requirement for AEMO to calculate certain information daily for use in
the STEM;</p></li>
<li><p>adjusting the present requirement to offer in at short-run
marginal cost where the Market Participant has market power, to
explicitly allow incorporation of a risk premium where a Market
Participant is uncertain of its ability to generate, including for
projected ESS provision; and</p></li>
<li><p>removing the requirement for Market Participants to lock-in
energy to meet their Net Bilateral Position in the STEM, allowing Market
Participants to leave some of their position open until the Real-Time
Market.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>As a result of Chapter 6 being limited to matters relating only to
the STEM, further amendments are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>sections 6.1 to 6.11 (STEM) will be retained subject to
amendments in these WEM Rules to reflect the changes outlined
above;</p></li>
<li><p>sections 6.11A and 6.12 (Non-Balancing Dispatch) are deleted and
replaced by new arrangements in the Central Dispatch Process in Chapter
7;</p></li>
<li><p>sections 6.13 and 6.14 (Settlement quantities) will be retained
subject to amendments to Settlement (Chapter 9);</p></li>
<li><p>section 6.15 (TES) is deleted as part of the amendments to
Settlement (Chapter 9);</p></li>
<li><p>section 6.16 (Metered Schedule) will be retained subject to
amendments to Settlement (Chapter 9);</p></li>
<li><p>sections 6.16A, 6.16B and clauses 6.17.3 to 6.17.5C (Out of Merit
and Constrained Payments) are deleted and replaced by uplift payments
and other amendments to Settlement (Chapter 9);</p></li>
<li><p>clauses 6.17.1 and 6.17.2 (Balancing Settlement Quantities) are
retained and renamed, and adjusted for the new Real-Time Market as
reflected in Settlement (Chapter 9);</p></li>
<li><p>clauses 6.17.6 to 6.17.8 (Non-Balancing Facility dispatch
payments) are deleted pursuant to amendments to Settlement (Chapter 9)
(and changes relating to the Reserve Capacity Mechanism that are
scheduled to commence on 1 October 2021);</p></li>
<li><p>clause 6.17.9 (Settlement Tolerance) is retained and moved to
Chapter 9 pursuant to the amendments to Settlement (Chapter 9);</p></li>
<li><p>clause 6.17.10 and section 6.18 (Portfolio Settlement Tolerance)
is deleted (as the portfolio will no longer exist under the new market
arrangements) pursuant to the amendments to Settlement (Chapter
9);</p></li>
<li><p>section 6.19 (Market Advisories) is deleted and merged with
Dispatch Advisories to create new Market Advisories in section
7.11;</p></li>
<li><p>section 6.20 (Energy Price Limits) is retained subject to
amendments pursuant to the amendments in the Market Power workstream;
and</p></li>
<li><p>section 6.21 (Settlement Data) is retained subject to amendments
to Settlement (Chapter 9).</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Various clauses in Chapter 6 are also amended to reflect the Amending
Rules contained in the Rule Change Panel's Final Report for Rule Change
Proposal RC_2014_03 (Administrative Improvements to the Outage
Process).</p>
<p>However, as this companion version of the WEM Rules only shows the
Tranches 2 and 3 Amendments as those amending rules (made by the
Minister at the date this companion version was prepared) will be
commenced last, please refer to the Final Report for Rule Change
Proposal RC_2014_03 (Administrative Improvements to the Outage Process)
to see the changes that will commence on 29 June 2021 and apply until
the relevant clauses in the Tranches 2 and 3 Amendments
commence.</p></th>
