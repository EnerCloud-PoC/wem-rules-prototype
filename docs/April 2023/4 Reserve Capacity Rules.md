The Reserve Capacity Cycle

4.1. The Reserve Capacity Cycle

4.1.1. This section 4.1 sets out the timetable by which the key events
described in this Chapter in respect of each Reserve Capacity Cycle must
occur. The events described below comprise a single Reserve Capacity
Cycle, except where otherwise indicated. The Reserve Capacity Cycle will
be repeated for each Capacity Year.

4.1.1A. Section 4.28C takes precedence over this section 4.1 and events
described in section 4.28C are not required to comply with the timetable
in this section 4.1 except where specified in section 4.28C.

4.1.1B. The description of an event in this section 4.1 is for the
purpose of identifying where it fits into the Reserve Capacity Cycle,
and does not affect the interpretation of the relevant provisions of
this Chapter 4.

4.1.1C. AEMO may modify or extend a date or time set under this section
4.1 and section 4.4B. If AEMO extends a date or time under this clause
4.1.1C, then it must publish notice of the modified or extended date or
time on the WEM Website and the modified or extended date or time takes
effect for the purposes of these WEM Rules.

4.1.2. \[Blank\]

4.1.3. Each Reserve Capacity Cycle:

\(a\) occurs over four successive calendar years (Year 1 to Year 4);

\(b\) is identified by reference to the calendar year in which Year 1 of
the Reserve Capacity Cycle falls; and

\(c\) relates to the Reserve Capacity required for the period between
the start of the first Trading Interval on 1 October of Year 3 and the
end of the last Trading Interval on 1 October of Year 4 of the Reserve
Capacity Cycle.

The ‘Capacity Credit Uplift’ only applies to non GIA Facilities.  The
uplift represents the difference between an initial NAQ value determined

Capacity Credits assigned to the Facility in the 2021 Reserve Capacity
Cycle, but is only provided up to the amount of Certified Reserve
Capacity assigned to the Facility in the Reserve Capacity Cycle that NAQ
is first assigned.</p>
<p>Capacity Credit Uplift Quantities are treated the same as Capacity
Credits for the purpose of the WEM Rules except that they will not be
taken into account when AEMO determines whether the Reserve Capacity
Requirement has been met.</p>
<p>The sum of a Facility’s NAQ and its Capacity Credit Uplift must not
exceed the Facility’s Certified Reserve Capacity.  If the sum of the NAQ

4.1A.3. Each Initial Network Access Quantity is to be expressed to a
precision of 0.001 MW.

4.1A.4. Subject to clause 4.1A.6, for the 2022 Reserve Capacity Cycle,
where a Facility, other than a GIA Facility, is assigned a Network
Access Quantity in accordance with section 4.15 that is less than the
Initial Network Access Quantity determined by AEMO under clause 4.1A.1,
AEMO must record the difference as the CC Uplift Quantity for the
Facility (“**CC Uplift Quantity**”).

4.1A.5. Where, in respect of a Reserve Capacity Cycle:

\(a\) a CC Uplift Quantity has been determined for a Facility; and

\(b\) the sum of the Network Access Quantity determined for the Facility
in accordance with section 4.15 and the CC Uplift Quantity determined
for the Facility exceeds the Certified Reserve Capacity for the Facility
for the Reserve Capacity Cycle,

then AEMO must reduce the CC Uplift Quantity so that the Network Access
Quantity and the revised CC Uplift Quantity equals the Certified Reserve
Capacity for the Facility for the Reserve Capacity Cycle.

4.1A.6. At any time the maximum amount of CC Uplift Quantity is to be
the sum recorded by AEMO under clause 4.1A.4, as may be reduced by AEMO
under clause 4.1A.5. To avoid doubt, a CC Uplift Quantity, as may be
reduced under clause 4.1A.5, may not be increased in any subsequent
Reserve Capacity Cycle.

4.1A.7. Any CC Uplift Quantity is deemed to be a Capacity Credit in the
same quantities and subject to the same obligations including testing
requirements, refunds, payment arrangements and all other provisions
applicable to Capacity Credits (including the determination of the
Reserve Capacity Price) under these WEM Rules save that for the purposes
of determining whether the Reserve Capacity Requirement has been met or
exceeded in accordance with clause 4.20.5A(aA), AEMO must disregard any

The Reserve Capacity Expression of Interest

4.2. The Reserve Capacity Expression of Interest Process

4.2.1. The purpose of the Reserve Capacity Expression of Interest is for
a person to notify AEMO of the amount of new Energy Producing System and
Demand Side Management capacity they intend to make available as Reserve
Capacity in the Capacity Year to which the Expression of Interest
relates. To avoid doubt, a Market Participant or other person, as
applicable, must submit an Expression of Interest as a condition of
being eligible to seek certification of Reserve Capacity under section
4.8 for any new capacity, which includes an upgrade of a Facility, in
the Reserve Capacity Cycle to which the Expression of Interest relates.

4.2.2. AEMO must prepare a Request for Expressions of Interest which
includes the information described in clause 4.3.1.

4.5.9. The Planning Criterion to be used by AEMO in undertaking a Long
Term PASA study is that there should be sufficient available capacity in
each Capacity Year during the Long Term PASA Study Horizon to:

\(a\) meet the forecast peak demand (including transmission losses and
allowing for Intermittent Loads) supplied through the SWIS plus a
reserve margin equal to the greater of:

i\. 7.6% of the forecast peak demand (including transmission losses and
allowing for Intermittent Loads); and

supply (related to any Facility, including a Network) expected at the
time of forecast peak demand (including transmission losses and allowing
for Intermittent Loads),

while maintaining the SWIS frequency in accordance with the Normal
Operating Frequency Band and the Normal Operating Frequency Excursion
Band. The forecast peak demand should be calculated to a probability
level that the forecast would not be expected to be exceeded in more
than one year out of ten; and

\(b\) limit expected energy shortfalls to 0.002% of annual energy
consumption (including transmission losses and taking into account
transmission network capabilities including constraints).

4.5.10. AEMO must use the information assembled to:

\(a\) assess the extent to which the anticipated installed capacity of
the Energy Producing Systems and Demand Side Management capacity is
capable of satisfying the Planning Criterion, identifying any capacity
shortfalls in each Relevant Year in the Long Term PASA Study Horizon,
for each of the following scenarios:

i\. median peak demand assuming low demand growth;

ii\. one in ten year peak demand assuming low demand growth;

iii\. median peak demand assuming expected demand growth;

iv\. one in ten year peak demand assuming expected demand growth;

v\. median peak demand assuming high demand growth;

vi\. one in ten year peak demand assuming high demand growth,

where the low, expected, and high demand growth cases reflect demand
changes stemming from different levels of economic growth, with these
being temperature adjusted to produce the one in ten year peak demand
cases.

\(b\) forecast the Reserve Capacity Target and corresponding expected
peak demand for each Capacity Year during the Long Term PASA Study
Horizon, where:

i\. the Reserve Capacity Target for a Capacity Year is the capacity
required to meet the Planning Criterion in that year under the scenario
described in clause 4.5.10(a)(iv); and

ii\. the expected peak demand in that year is the peak demand under the
scenario described in clause 4.5.10(a)(iv);

\(c\) identify and assess any potential capacity shortfalls isolated to
a sub-region of the SWIS resulting from expected restrictions on
transmission capability or other factors;

\(d\) identify any potential transmission, generation, storage or demand
side capacity augmentation options to alleviate capacity shortfalls
identified in clauses 4.5.10(a) and 4.5.10(c); and

\(e\) develop a two dimensional duration curve of the forecast minimum
capacity requirements over the Capacity Year (“Availability Curve”) for
each of the second and third Capacity Years of the Long Term PASA Study
Horizon. The forecast minimum capacity requirement for each Trading
Interval in the Capacity Year must be determined as the sum of:

i\. the forecast demand (including transmission losses and allowing for
Intermittent Loads) for that Trading Interval under the scenario
described in clause 4.5.10(a)(iv); and

ii\. the difference between the Reserve Capacity Target for the Capacity
Year and the maximum of the quantities determined under clause
4.5.10(e)(i) for the Trading Intervals in the Capacity Year.

4.5.11. AEMO must publish the Statement of Opportunities Report for a
Reserve Capacity Cycle by the date specified in clause 4.1.8.

4.5.12. For the second and third Capacity Years of the Long Term PASA
Study Horizon, AEMO must determine the following information:

\(a\) \[Blank\]

\(b\) the minimum capacity required to be provided by Availability
Class 1 capacity if Power System Security and Power System Reliability
is to be maintained. This minimum capacity is to be set at a level such
that if:

i all Availability Class 2 capacity were activated during the Capacity
Year so as to minimise the peak demand during that Capacity Year; and

ii the Planning Criterion and the criteria for evaluating Outage Plans
set out in clause 3.18E.8 were to be applied to the load scenario
defined by clause 4.5.12(b)(i), then

it would be possible to satisfy the Planning Criterion and the Outage
Evaluation Criteria, as applied in clause 4.5.12(b)(ii), using, to the
extent that the capacity is anticipated to provide Certified Reserve
Capacity, the anticipated installed Availability Class 1 capacity and,
to the extent that further Availability Class 1 capacity would be
required, an appropriate mix of Availability Class 1 capacity to make up
that shortfall; and

\(c\) the capacity associated with Availability Class 2, where this is
equal to the Reserve Capacity Target for the Capacity Year less the
minimum capacity required to be provided by Availability Class 1
capacity under clause 4.5.12(b).

4.13. Reserve Capacity Security[3]

4.13.1. Where AEMO assigns Certified Reserve Capacity to a Facility
(which, for the purposes of this section 4.13, excludes a Demand Side
Programme) that is yet to enter service (or re-enter service after
significant maintenance or having been upgraded), the relevant Market
Participant must ensure that AEMO holds the benefit of a Reserve
Capacity Security that is:

\(a\) in the form specified in clause 4.13.5; and

\(b\) an amount determined under clause 4.13.2(a) by the date and time
specified in clause 4.1.13.

4.13.1A For the purposes of this section 4.13, where an existing
Facility is undergoing significant maintenance or being upgraded the
requirement to provide Reserve Capacity Security applies only to the
part of the Facility either undergoing significant maintenance or being
upgraded.

4.13.1B. The obligation under clause 4.13.1 to provide Reserve Capacity
Security does not apply where the Market Participant has provided
Reserve Capacity Security in relation to the same Facility for a
previous Reserve Capacity Cycle, unless:

\(a\) the Facility is an existing Facility undergoing significant
maintenance or being upgraded; or

\(b\) AEMO cancelled the Capacity Credits assigned to the Facility for
that previous Reserve Capacity Cycle in accordance with clause 4.20.14.

4.13.1C For the purposes of this section 4.13, a Facility includes part
of a Facility, any upgrade or significant maintenance to an existing
Facility, unless otherwise stated.

4.13.2. For the purposes of this section 4.13 the amount of Reserve
Capacity Security is:

\(a\) at the time and date referred to in clause 4.1.13, 25 percent of
the Benchmark Reserve Capacity Price included in the Request for
Expressions of Interest issued for the relevant Reserve Capacity Cycle,
expressed in $/MW per year, multiplied by an amount equal to:

i\. the Certified Reserve Capacity assigned to the Facility; less

ii\. the total of any Certified Reserve Capacity amount specified in
accordance with clause 4.14.1(d) or referred to in clause 4.14.7(c)(ii);
and

\(b\) at the time and date referred to in clause 4.1.21, 25 percent of
the Benchmark Reserve Capacity Price included in the Request for
Expressions of Interest issued for the relevant Reserve Capacity Cycle,
expressed in $/MW per year, multiplied by an amount equal to the total
number of Capacity Credits assigned to the Facility under
clause 4.20.5A.

4.13.2A A Market Participant may apply to AEMO for a recalculation of
the amount of Reserve Capacity Security required to be held for a
Facility using the formula in clause 4.13.2(b) after the time and date
referred to in clause 4.1.21.

4.13.2B Within 10 Business Days after receipt of a request from a Market
Participant under clause 4.13.2A AEMO must recalculate the amount of
Reserve Capacity Security required to be held by a Facility using the
formula in clause 4.13.2(b). If the amount recalculated by AEMO under
clause 4.13.2(b) is less than that originally calculated under clause
4.13.2(a) then AEMO must:

\(a\) notify the Market Participant of the result of the calculation;

\(b\) offer the Market Participant the opportunity to replace the
Reserve Capacity Security in accordance with clause 4.13.2C, and

\(c\) if the Market Participant provides a replacement Reserve Capacity
Security in accordance with clause 4.13.2C, return any excess Reserve
Capacity Security.

4.13.2C Where under clause 4.13.2B AEMO notifies a Market Participant
that excess Reserve Capacity Security is currently held, then a Market
Participant may replace the existing Reserve Capacity Security with
replacement Reserve Capacity Security which must:

\(a\) be in the form specified in clause 4.13.5;

\(b\) be an amount not less than the amount required under clause
4.13.2(b); and

\(c\) become effective before AEMO returns any excess Reserve Capacity
Security.

4.13.3. Where a Market Participant’s existing Reserve Capacity Security
is due to expire or cease to have effect for any other reason and after
that expiration the Market Participant will continue to have an
obligation to ensure AEMO holds the benefit of a Reserve Capacity
Security under clause 4.13.1, then that Market Participant must ensure
that AEMO holds the benefit of replacement Reserve Capacity Security
that is:

\(a\) in the form specified in clause 4.13.5;

\(b\) an amount not less than the amount required under clause 4.13.2;
and

\(c\) effective when the existing Reserve Capacity Security expires or
otherwise ceases to have effect.

4.13A. DSM Reserve Capacity Security

4.13A.1. Where AEMO assigns Certified Reserve Capacity to a Demand Side
Programme, the relevant Market Participant must ensure that AEMO holds
the benefit of DSM Reserve Capacity Security that is:

\(a\) where:

i\. clause 4.1.13 applies, for an amount determined under clause
4.13A.2(a) by the date and time referred to in clause 4.1.13; or

ii\. clause 4.1.21 applies, for an amount determined under clause
4.13A.2(b) by the date and time referred to in clause 4.1.21; and

\(b\) in the form specified in clause 4.13A.6.

4.13A.2. For the purposes of this section 4.13A, the amount of DSM
Reserve Capacity Security is:

\(a\) 25 percent of the Benchmark Reserve Capacity Price included in the
Request for Expressions of Interest issued for the relevant Reserve
Capacity Cycle, expressed in $/MW per year, multiplied by an amount
equal to:

i\. the Certified Reserve Capacity assigned to the Demand Side
Programme; less

ii\. the total of any Certified Reserve Capacity amount specified in
accordance with clause 4.14.1(d) or referred to in clause 4.14.7(c)(ii);
or

\(b\) 25 percent of the Benchmark Reserve Capacity Price included in the
Request for Expressions of Interest issued for the relevant Reserve
Capacity Cycle, expressed in $/MW per year, multiplied by an amount
equal to the total number of Capacity Credits assigned to the Demand
Side Programme under clause 4.20.5A.

4.13A.3. Where:

\(a\) AEMO holds the benefit of a DSM Reserve Capacity Security in
accordance with this section 4.13A in respect of a Demand Side Programme
for a Reserve Capacity Cycle; and

\(b\) AEMO assigns Certified Reserve Capacity to the same Demand Side
Programme for a subsequent Reserve Capacity Cycle,

then the DSM Reserve Capacity Security for the previous Reserve Capacity
Cycle will be deemed to satisfy the requirement in clause 4.13A.1 for
AEMO to have the benefit of DSM Reserve Capacity Security for the
subsequent Reserve Capacity Cycle if:

\(c\) the amount of the DSM Reserve Capacity Security complies with
clause 4.13A.4; and

\(d\) the DSM Reserve Capacity Security remains in force at all relevant
times for the purposes of this section 4.13A.

4.13A.4. Subject to clause 4.13A.5, where a Market Participant is
required to ensure that AEMO holds the benefit of DSM Reserve Capacity
Security for more than one Reserve Capacity Cycle, the total amount of
the DSM Reserve Capacity Security for all of those Reserve Capacity
Cycles in aggregate is the highest amount determined under clause
4.13A.1.

4.13A.5. The amount determined under clause 4.13A.4 does not include
Reserve Capacity Cycles for which the Demand Side Programme does not
have any Reserve Capacity Obligations.

4.13A.6. The DSM Reserve Capacity Security for a Demand Side Programme
must be:

\(a\) an obligation in writing that:

i\. is from a Security Provider;

ii\. is a guarantee or bank undertaking in a form prescribed by AEMO;

iii\. is duly executed by the Security Provider and delivered
unconditionally to AEMO;

iv\. constitutes valid and binding unsubordinated obligations of the
Security Provider to pay to AEMO amounts in accordance with its terms
which relate to the relevant Market Participant’s obligations under the
WEM Rules to pay compensation under this section 4.13A; and

v\. permits drawings or claims by AEMO up to a stated amount; or

\(b\) if AEMO in its discretion considers it an acceptable alternative
in the circumstances to the obligation under clause 4.13A.6(a), a
Security Deposit.

4.13A.7. If, at any time, and for whatever reason, the amount of the DSM
Reserve Capacity Security is less than the amount determined in
accordance with clauses 4.13A.1 or 4.13A.4, as applicable, the Market
Participant must immediately:

\(a\) in the case of a DSM Reserve Capacity Security in the form
specified in clause 4.13A.6(a):

i\. replace the DSM Reserve Capacity Security for the amount determined
in accordance with clauses 4.13A.1 or 4.13A.4, as applicable; or

ii\. provide a further DSM Reserve Capacity Security for the difference
between the amount of the DSM Reserve Capacity Security and the amount
determined in accordance with clauses 4.13A.1 or 4.13A.4, as applicable,

and, in both cases, the DSM Reserve Capacity Security must comply with
clause 4.13A.6(a); or

\(b\) in the case of a Security Deposit, increase the amount of the
Security Deposit to the amount determined in accordance with clauses
4.13A.1 or 4.13A.4, as applicable, and do all other things AEMO may
require, including signing any deeds or other documents, to ensure AEMO
has the benefit of the increase in the amount of the Security Deposit.

4.13A.8. In respect of a Reserve Capacity Cycle, after the time and date
referred to in clause 4.1.23, a Market Participant may apply to AEMO for
a recalculation of the amount of DSM Reserve Capacity Security required
to be held for a Demand Side Programme under clauses 4.13A.1 or 4.13A.4,
as applicable.

4.13A.9. Within ten Business Days after receipt of a request from a
Market Participant under clause 4.13A.8, AEMO must recalculate the
amount of DSM Reserve Capacity Security required to be held for a Demand
Side Programme under clauses 4.13A.1 or 4.13A.4, as applicable. If the
amount recalculated by AEMO under clauses 4.13A.1 or 4.13A.4, as
applicable, is less than that previously calculated under clauses
4.13A.1 or 4.13A.4, as applicable, then AEMO must:

\(a\) notify the Market Participant of the result of the calculation;

\(b\) offer the Market Participant the opportunity to replace the DSM
Reserve Capacity Security in accordance with clause 4.13A.10, and

\(c\) if the Market Participant provides a replacement DSM Reserve
Capacity Security in accordance with clause 4.13A.10, return any excess
DSM Reserve Capacity Security.

4.13A.10. Where under clause 4.13A.9 AEMO notifies a Market Participant
that excess DSM Reserve Capacity Security is currently held, then a
Market Participant may replace the existing DSM Reserve Capacity
Security with replacement DSM Reserve Capacity Security which must:

\(a\) be in the form specified in clause 4.13A.6;

\(b\) be an amount not less than the amount required under clauses
4.13A.1 or 4.13A.4, as applicable; and

\(c\) become effective before AEMO returns any excess DSM Reserve
Capacity Security.

4.13A.11. Where a Market Participant’s existing DSM Reserve Capacity
Security is due to expire or cease to have effect for any reason and
after that expiration the Market Participant will continue to have an
obligation to ensure AEMO holds the benefit of DSM Reserve Capacity
Security under clause 4.13A.1, then the Market Participant must ensure
that AEMO holds the benefit of replacement DSM Reserve Capacity Security
that is:

\(a\) in the form specified in clause 4.13A.6;

\(b\) an amount not less than the amount required under clauses 4.13A.1
or 4.13A.4, as applicable; and

\(c\) effective when the existing DSM Reserve Capacity Security expires
or otherwise ceases to have effect.

4.13A.12. Where a Market Participant’s DSM Reserve Capacity Security is
affected by any of the circumstances specified in the WEM Procedure
referred to in clause 4.13A.23 that may require replacement DSM Reserve
Capacity Security, then the Market Participant must ensure that AEMO
holds the benefit of replacement DSM Reserve Capacity Security that is:

\(a\) in the form specified in clause 4.13A.6;

\(b\) an amount not less than the level required under clauses 4.13A.1
or 4.13A.4, as applicable; and

\(c\) effective before the end of the next Business Day or within any
longer period approved in writing by AEMO after the Market Participant
first becomes aware of the relevant change in circumstance (whether by
reason of the Market Participant’s own knowledge or a notification by
AEMO).

<tr class="header">
<th><p><strong>Explanatory Note</strong></p>
<p>Section 4.15 sets out the new Network Access Quantity
(<strong>NAQ</strong>) framework.</p>
<p>The NAQ:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>defines the network capacity, in MW, available to a Facility for
the purpose of determining the Capacity Credits that can be assigned to
the Facility up to the amount of its Certified Reserve Capacity;
and</p></li>
<li><p>establishes a preferential right to receive a Capacity Credit,
which can only be reduced in specific circumstances.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The primary purpose of the NAQ is to protect a Facility’s quantity of
Capacity Credits from an unhedgeable risk of being inefficiently
displaced by new entrant facilities connecting in constrained sections
of the network, where that additional capacity is not needed for system
reliability but is simply displacing an existing performing
resource.</p>
<p>The NAQ protects the investment in Facilities that continue to
participate in the RCM and meet all their performance obligations. A
Facility that, for reasons related to its own poor performance, fails to
provide its capacity to the RCM when required by the system surrenders
its ability to retain the unreliable portion of its NAQ. A Facility that
retires (or is mothballed or removed from service) must relinquish its
NAQ.</p>
<p>The NAQ is determined in relation to network capacity and is based on
the physical limits of the network. Hence, the NAQ serves as a cap on
the amount of Capacity Credits that can be assigned in specific regions
of the network. NAQ will be determined for a Facility up to the amount
of network capacity that can accommodate the Facility’s Certified
Reserve Capacity at peak times or other periods of low reserve. This
will ensure that the sum of NAQ determined for Facilities in specific
network regions (and in aggregate for the network as a whole) does not
exceed the transfer capability of the network.</p>
<p>Once NAQ is determined, new Facilities seeking to connect in a
specific region of the network can only receive NAQ up to the residual
capacity of the network in that region, after accounting for NAQ that
has already been determined.</p>
<p>A Facility’s NAQ can be reduced or increased due to ‘organic’ changes
that are beyond the control of the Facility i.e. due to changes in
demand, network configuration, or weather conditions for intermittent
facilities. The policy position is to afford these facilities a priority
for additional NAQ should conditions improve (ahead of other capacity).
This is intended to be implemented in the new framework by tracking a
‘Highest Network Access Quantity’ value.</p>
<p>The NAQ has no role in dispatch or settlement of the energy or ESS
markets, which will operate under the new Security Constrained Economic
Dispatch market model.</p>
<p>In accordance with the Miscellaneous Amendments No. 2, section 4.15
will be amended to '[Blank'] for the period from 1 March 2022 until the
amendments contained in the Tranches 2 and 3 Amendments (i.e. those set
out below) below commence on 1 September 2022.</p></th>

<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th><p><strong>Explanatory Note</strong></p>
<p>Clause 4.15.1 requires AEMO to determine NAQs for relevant
Facilities.</p>
<p>A Facility’s NAQ is a function of:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>the Facility’s Certified Reserve Capacity; and</p></li>
<li><p>the network capacity that is available to accommodate the
Facility’s Certified Reserve Capacity.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Therefore, once AEMO has verified the performance capability of the
Facility (through the process of assigning Certified Reserve Capacity)
AEMO will then conduct an assessment (through a network capacity
modelling exercise) to determine how much of the Facility’s certified
output can be accommodated by the network.</p>
<p>Clause 4.15.5 will be replaced by the <em>Wholesale Electricity
Market Amendment (Tranche 5 Amendments) Rules 2021</em> (<strong>Tranche
5 Amendments</strong>) on 1 September 2022.</p>
<p>Tranche 6 Exposure Draft 1 included proposed amendments to ensure
that the facility dispatch scenarios developed by AEMO for use with the
Network Access Quantity Model consider Facilities with Early Certified
Reserve Capacity.</p>
<p>An additional issue with this clause was identified by AEMO after the
publication of Tranche 6 Exposure Draft 1. Depending on the relevant
Step in Appendix 3, a Facilities may be dispatched up to their Certified
Reserve Capacity or their Network Access Quantity assigned in the
previous Reserve Capacity Cycle. In the situation where either the total
assigned Certified Reserve Capacity or Network Access Quantities is less
than the peak demand it will be impossible for AEMO to satisfy clause
4.15.5(c).</p>
<p>For this reason, clause 4.15.5 is further amended to remove clause
4.15.5(c). How AEMO will create facility dispatch scenarios in a
shortfall situation will be covered in the Network Access Quantity WEM
Procedure.</p>
<p>Finally, following the consultation period for Tranche 6 Exposure
Draft 2, AEMO made a further suggestion to remove the requirement to
model NCESS for the creation of facility dispatch scenarios. AEMO
suggested to create Constraint Equations to ensure that during a solve,
the Facilities redispatch always meet the NCESS requirement. AEMO
considers that modelling the NCESS in the facility dispatch scenarios
may have an adverse impact that could result in overallocation of
Network Access Quantities to an NCESS Facility. In addition, the
solution using Constraint Equations is easier to implement and
consistent with the current design of the NAQ model.</p>
<p>In making its recommendation, AEMO (in consultation with Western
Power) considered whether it would be feasible to translate all possible
types of NCESS into Constraint Equations, considering the type of
constraint could be very different compared to Network thermal
constraints. AEMO and Western Power identified two scenarios where it
would not be possible to use a Constraint Equation to enforce an
NCESS:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>if the NCESS influences the dispatch of a Non Scheduled Facility
- note the NSF have a set dispatch value equal to their traded Certified
Reserve Capacity at any time, consistent with clause 4.15.9(d) that
requires AEMO to treat them as unconstrained; and</p></li>
<li><p>if the NCESS translates into a non-linear equation.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Both Western Power and AEMO do not foresee either of these scenarios
happening in the near future. In the event of an NCESS requiring either
the constraint of a NSF or to use a non-linear equation, AEMO would be
able to make modifications required to the NAQ model to account for it.
However, anticipating the design for this unlikely edge case would
require non-negligible effort and time and AEMO does not think this is
appropriate at this stage.</p></th>

consumption of electricity supplied through the SWIS from that which the
consumer would have otherwise consumed, but excluding reductions
provided by a Market Participant with a Demand Side Programme that does
not satisfy its Reserve Capacity Obligations during the current Capacity
Year or a previous Capacity Year;

\(b\) the production of electricity by Energy Producing Systems that are
not Registered Facilities; and

\(c\) the production of electricity by Energy Producing Systems that are

Contract, but must use reasonable endeavours to minimise the cost of
Eligible Services acquired in this manner.

4.24.11A. Where AEMO has issued a call for tenders under clauses
4.24.2(a) or 4.24.2(b)(i), AEMO must not enter into negotiations for a
negotiated Supplementary Capacity Contract under clause 4.24.11 before
the completion of the tender, including, to avoid doubt, assessment of
all in-time responses received by AEMO in response to the tender.

4.24.12. AEMO must, in consultation with stakeholders, develop and
maintain a standard form Supplementary Capacity Contract, which accords
with the requirements in clause 4.24.13.

<p>Clause 4.29.1 is amended as a consequence of the deletion of the
Reserve Capacity Auction, and to remove redundant references to previous
Reserve Capacity Cycles.</p>
<p>Clause 4.29.1 (and section 4.29) was amended pursuant to RCM Pricing
Reforms to accommodate the changes to the price to be paid for Reserve
Capacity from the 2019 Reserve Capacity Cycle. To facilitate the pricing
reforms, the clause was restructured so that clause 4.29.1 calculates
the annual Reserve Capacity Price, instead of a Facility Monthly Reserve
Capacity Price which is now calculated in accordance with clause
4.29.1A.</p>
<p>As a result of the RCM Pricing Reforms and the deletion of the
Reserve Capacity Auction, Facilities will receive the same Reserve
Capacity Price except in two situations.</p>
<p>Firstly, if the Facility is a Transitional Facility and the Reserve
Capacity Cycle is a Transitional Reserve Capacity Cycle, the Reserve
Capacity Price for the Facility will be as determined in accordance with
clause 4.29.1B. A Transitional Facility is an existing Facility (other
than a DSP) that was assigned Capacity Credits in the 2018 Reserve
Capacity Cycle. A Transitional Facility will be assigned Capacity
Credits at the Reserve Capacity Price subject to a floor of $114,000 and
a cap of $140,000. The cap and floor prices will be escalated in each of
the subsequent nine Reserve Capacity Cycles (i.e. up to and including
the 2028 Reserve Capacity Cycle) by the Reserve Bank of Australia's
Statement of Monetary Policy forecast Consumer Price Index for June of
Year 3 of the relevant Reserve Capacity Cycle in accordance with clause
4.29.1C.</p>
<p>Secondly, if the Facility is a Fixed Price Facility and the Reserve
Capacity Cycle is a Fixed Price Reserve Capacity Cycle for that Fixed
Price Facility, the Reserve Capacity Price for the Facility will be the
value determined in accordance with clause 4.29.1D. A Fixed Price
Facility is a Facility that will be assigned Capacity Credits at the
Reserve Capacity Price in the first Reserve Capacity Cycle in which it
is classified as a Fixed Price Facility. That Reserve Capacity Price
will be escalated in each of the subsequent four Reserve Capacity Cycles
by the Reserve Bank of Australia's Statement of Monetary Policy forecast
Consumer Price Index for June of Year 3 of the relevant Reserve Capacity
Cycle.</p>
<p>Upgrades of Facilities will receive the same Reserve Capacity Price
as the parent Facility unless the upgrade is a separate Facility for the
purposes of the WEM Rules. The main reason for this approach is the
absence of separate metering for the parent Facility and any associated
upgrade.</p>
<p>Clause 4.29.1(b) is further amended to correct a transcription error
by removing the brackets around ‘surplus + BRCP Cap Factor’.</p></th>

allow participants to do this (by withdrawing a CCA and submitting
another one). [4.30.10]. The current rule drafting for Capacity Credit
Allocation amendments adds implementation complexity for no benefit to
the market.</p></li>
<li><p>The rules put a 2 day deadline for CCA amendments to be resolved.
This was previously important, as changes to CCAs would impact a Market
Participant’s Trading Margin, and therefore is time-sensitive; however,
this is no longer the case. [4.30.10 and 4.30.11] The current rule
drafting for resolving Capacity Credit Allocation amendments within 2
days adds implementation complexity for no benefit to the
market.</p></li>
<li><p>The rules put a requirement for AEMO to amend CCAs by 5PM on the
Scheduling Day if a participant does not amend the CCAs by 5PM on the
Scheduling Day. [4.30.11] This makes it impossible for AEMO to comply
with the obligation by amending them exactly at 5PM on the Scheduling
Day.</p></li>
<li><p>The current drafting also explicitly refers to terminations
identified in clause 4.30.9. It should be written more generally to
consider any situation where the CCAs for a Facility exceed the Capacity
Credits (e.g. where a Facility is transferred, the outgoingl Facility
owner having CCAs for a Facility they no longer own).</p></li>
