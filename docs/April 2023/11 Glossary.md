<p>New definition for ‘Not In-Service Capacity’ is used in clause
4.26.2AA.5(b)(ii).</p>
<p>Currently a Market Participant must submit in its Balancing
Submissions prices and quantities at which it is willing to dispatch its
Facilities. If plant is unavailable this must be declared and be
accompanied by either a planned or forced outage declaration. As a
result there will be direct financial consequences for the Market
Participant in the RCM. All plant which is declared “available” would be
subject to receiving a dispatch instruction if it is in merit. Again,
there will be consequences for the Market Participant if it is unable to
respond to a Dispatch Instruction.</p>
<p>However, under the new changes to the availability declarations, a
declaration “Available but not in service” could allow a Market
Participant to avoid being dispatched while still declaring it is
available in its real time market submissions. Even if it is in merit it
will not be issued a dispatch instructions unless it changes its status
to in service.</p>

<p>The definition of Small Aggregation as a Facility Technology Type
will be reviewed holistically with both the policy intent for facility
aggregation (at both transmission and distribution level) as well as how
DER is to participate in the WEM in the future. However, for the
purposes of the RCM, the definition of Small Aggregation as set out
below suffices to enable distributed energy resources to aggregate
behind the same TNI and participate in the RCM. These small aggregations
are expected to be registered as Non-Scheduled Facilities.</p>
<p>The definition of System Size considers contracted access to the
market which estimates the impact of a facility on the market. This
definition also explicitly references the charge and discharge
capability of Electric Storage Resources and this avoids the need to
specify single cycle changes. System Size is used in sections 2.28 and
2.29 of the Tranches 2 and 3 Amendments in the context of energy
producing systems at unregistered facilities and therefore the
definition has changed Facility to facility to account for both
registered and unregistered facilities. The definition of System Size
uses the term energy producing equipment instead of energy producing
system to denote the fact that the system comprises the entirety of all
generating and storage equipment at the facility.</p></th>

<p>This runway calculation does not include Intermittent Loads.
Intermittent Loads will be added to the runway calculation in a future
tranche of Amending Rules once the registration framework is
finalised.</p>
<p>1.1 This Appendix 2A sets out the steps that are to be followed by
AEMO in determining <em>TotalRunwayShare(p,DI)</em>, being the
allocation share of Market Participant p in Dispatch Interval DI for the
costs of procuring:</p>
<p>(a) Contingency Reserve Raise (see clause 9.10.30); and</p>
<p>(b) Additional RoCoF Control Requirement component of RoCoF Control
Service (see clause 9.10.34)</p>
<p>by use of a "modified runway allocation method" for each Dispatch
Interval allocating the share of the costs above to Market Participants
based on their Facility Risk (see Glossary) in the Dispatch
Interval.</p>
<p>1.2 The cost of procuring Contingency Reserve Raise and Additional
RoCoF Control Requirement component of RoCoF Control Service (jointly
referred to as the relevant Essential System Service) is allocated to
Registered Facilities with a Facility Risk greater than 10MW (see Clause
2.3 of this Appendix 2A).</p>
<p>1.3 The cost of procuring the relevant Essential System Service is
split into two components (see clause 5.1 of this Appendix 2A):</p>
<p>(a) A Network Component - this is calculated in clause 5.1(a) of this
Appendix 2A:</p>
<p>(i) This component is zero if the Largest Credible Supply Contingency
is not set by a Network Contingency. It is also zero if the Largest
Network Risk equals the Largest Facility Risk (i.e. a Facility
Contingency and Network Contingency are tied as the Largest Credible
Supply Contingency).</p>
<p>(ii) This component is non-zero if the Largest Credible Supply
Contingency is set by a Network Contingency and is not set by a Facility
Contingency as the Largest Credible Supply Contingency. In this case,
the share Network Component is calculated as the ratio of</p>
<p>(A) the difference between the Largest Network Risk and the Largest
Facility Risk; and</p>
<p>(B) the Largest Network Risk.</p>
<p>(iii) This ensures that causers of Network Contingencies only
pay:</p>
<p>(A) when their Network Contingency sets the Contingency Reserve Raise
Requirement;</p>
<p>(B) a delta - in that their cost allocation is based on the
additional relevant Essential System Service procured as a result of
their Network Contingency setting the Contingency Reserve Raise
Requirement.</p>
<p><em>For example, if Largest Network Risk = 300 (set by region A) and
Largest Facility Risk = 240 (set by generator X), then the causers of
the Region A Network Contingency would pay (300-240)/300 = 20% of the
relevant Essential System Service costs in a given Dispatch
Interval.</em></p>
<p>(iv) If two or more Network Contingencies set the Largest Credible
Supply contingency, then each tied Network Contingency is allocated an
equal share of the Network Component.</p>
<p><em>For example, if two Network Contingencies were tied with Largest
Network Risk = 300 (set by region A and region B) in the example above,
then the causers of the each Network Contingency would pay 20%/2 = 10%
of the relevant Essential System Service costs in a given Dispatch
Interval.</em></p>
<p>(b) A Facility Component (see clause 5.1(b) of this Appendix 2A)
which equals one minus the Network Component calculated above. This
component equals 100% if a Facility Contingency sets the Largest
Credible Supply Contingency.</p>
<p>1.4 Appendix 2A calculates runway shares for Registered Facilities
separately for:</p>
<p>(a) Facilities deemed to be causers of Facility Contingencies (see
Section 3 of this Appendix 2A: Applicable Facility Shares, and clause
3.3 of this Appendix 2A, which calculates the runway shares)</p>
<p>(b) Facilities deemed to be causers of Network Contingencies (see
Section 4 of this Appendix A: Network Contingency Shares, and clause 4.5
of this Appendix 2A, which calculates the runway shares)</p>
<p>Runway shares are calculated by ranking each Facility’s Facility Risk
value, and allocating them a share based on their rank (similar to the
calculation in Appendix 2 of the current WEM Rules).</p>
<p>1.5 Once the runway shares above have been calculated, participant
cost shares (<em>TotalRunwayShare(p,DI)</em>) are calculated in clause
5.3 of this Appendix 2A by taking into account:</p>
<p>(a) The Facility Component and Network Component ratios calculated in
clause 5.1 of this Appendix 2A</p>
<p>(b) The number of Network Contingencies tied as the Largest Credible
Supply Contingency (if any) in clause 5.2 of this Appendix 2A</p>
<p>(c) The facility runway shares and the network runway shares
calculated in clauses 3.3 and 4.5 of this Appendix 2A respectively.</p>
<p>Appendix 2A is also amended to include unregistered Energy Producing
Systems serving Intermittent Loads. If the Market Participant
responsible for the Non-Dispatchable Load portion of a Facility
containing an Intermittent Load is different from the Market Participant
responsible for the Registered Facility component, the runway share will
be allocated to:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>the Registered Facility when total facility export is greater
than the output of any one behind the meter unit; or</p></li>
<li><p>the Non-Dispatchable Load when the output of any one behind the
meter unit is greater than total Facility export.</p></li>

Appendix 2A: Runway share calculation method

1\. Interpretation and calculation of a Market Participant's Total
Runway Share

1.1 Where anything is to be determined, calculated or done in this
Appendix 2A, then except where otherwise stated, AEMO will determine,
calculate or do, as the case may be, those things.

1.2 AEMO must calculate a Market Participant's total runway share of
procuring Contingency Reserve Raise and the Additional RoCoF Requirement
component of RoCoF Control Service in Dispatch Interval DI by following
each of the steps set out in the rest of this Appendix 2A.

1.3 Each electricity producing unit in an Energy Producing System
supplying an Intermittent Load to which clause 2.1(c) of this Appendix
2A applies is treated as a separate Facility for the purposes of this
Appendix 2A.

Appendix 2C: SESSM refund calculation method

1\. Interpretation

1.1 Where anything is to be determined, calculated or done in this
Appendix 2C, then except where otherwise stated, AEMO will determine,
calculate or do, as the case may be, those things.

2\. Supplementary Essential System Service Mechanism refund calculation
methodology

2.1 AEMO must calculate the refund payable by a Market Participant in
respect of their Registered Facility for not meeting the SESSM
Availability Requirements set out in the relevant SESSM Awards by
following each of the steps set out in the rest of this Appendix 2C.

accredited for at the time of making the SESSM Submission that resulted
in award a. The Base Quantity can be different in different Dispatch
Intervals. For example:</p></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><blockquote>
<p>Facility X has been accredited for 25MW of Contingency Reserve Raise
(with no SESSM triggered). A SESSM is triggered and Facility X has now
been awarded an Availability Quantity of 15 MW in all Dispatch Intervals
(under award a). The Base ESS Quantity or Base Quantity(a, DI) =
25MW.</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote>
<p>Facility Y is a new Facility, and is applying under a SESSM to
provide FCESS. Y is awarded an Availability Quantity of 10MW in all
Dispatch Intervals, under award a1. The Base Quantity(a, DI) = 0 MW for
all Dispatch Intervals (because it was not accredited previously). At a
later stage, it undergoes an upgrade, and under SESSM Award a2, it is
awarded an additional Availability Quantity (over and above a1) of 5MW
in all Dispatch Intervals. Base Quantity(a2,DI) = 10 MW, which is the
maximum that Y was accredited for under award a1 (at the time they were
awarded a2).</p>
</blockquote></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><p>The AvailabilityQuantity(a,DI) or Availability Quantity, denotes
the MW or MWs quantity of the ESS the Facility must offer in addition to
the Base ESS Quantity in a given Dispatch in at least
MinAvailability(a)% (see below) of the time during the SESSM Service
Timing. The Availability Quantity can be different in different Dispatch
Intervals. The Market Participant must offer the sum of the relevant
Availability Quantity and Base ESS Quantity (for a given SESSM Award
a):</p></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><blockquote>
<p>In the example above, Facility X, must offer 25MW (Base ESS Quantity)

<ul>
<li><blockquote>
<p>In the second example, above:</p>
</blockquote>
<p> Under award a1, Y must provide offer 0MW (Base ESS Quantity) + 10MW
(Availability Quantity) = 10 MW in all Dispatch Intervals.</p>
<p> Under award a2, Y must provide offer 10MW (Base ESS Quantity) + 5MW

<ul>
<li><p>The AvailabilityPayment(a,DI) or Per-Dispatch Interval
Availability Payment, is the price per Dispatch Interval that the Market
Participant will be paid for offering the Availability Quantity in a

where the Availability Quantity is zero, and is a flat $/Dispatch
Interval figure in Dispatch Intervals where Availability Quantity is
non-zero.</p></li>
<li><p>MinAvailability(a) or SESSM Minimum Availability Requirement,
denotes the % of relevant Dispatch Intervals that the Market Participant
must make the sum of the AvailabilityQuantity(a,DI) and
BaseQuantity(a,DI) available (i.e. the Market Participant must make all
of that quantity available at least MinAvailability % of the applicable
Dispatch Intervals).</p></li>

<p>Appendix 3 is amended to:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>remove the Reserve Capacity Auction; and</p></li>
<li><p>prescribe the prioritisation order for determining Network Access
Quantities (<strong>NAQ</strong>) for Facilities for a Reserve Capacity
Cycle (<strong>RCC</strong>).</p></li>
</ul>
<p>This Appendix should be read in conjunction with new proposed section
4.15 – Network Access Quantity.</p>
<p>The <em>Wholesale Electricity Market Amendment (Reserve Capacity
Pricing Reforms) Rules 2019</em> that commenced on 22 February 2020
introduced new provisions for assigning Capacity Credits in scenarios
where no new Facilities wish to receive a fixed Reserve Capacity Price
(<strong>Scenario 1</strong>) and where one or more new Facilities wish
to receive a fixed Reserve Capacity Price (<strong>Scenario
2</strong>).</p>
<p>The NAQ determination process has been designed to accommodate the
changes to the prioritisation order that was introduced by the Reserve
Capacity Mechanism (<strong>RCM</strong>) pricing reforms.</p>
<p><strong>Scenario 1 – there are no nominated Fixed Price
Facilities</strong></p>
<p>If the Reserve Capacity Requirement (<strong>RCR</strong>) is not met
after an NAQ is determined for all existing and committed Facilities,
AEMO will determine a NAQ for proposed Facilities, applying a new
prioritisation order, until the RCR is achieved or there are no
Facilities left.</p>
<p>In accordance with the new prioritisation order, AEMO will not select
a proposed Facility where the NAQ determined for the Facility is less
than a specified minimum quantity of Capacity Credits (the quantity of
which is based on the facility's NAQ) for the Facility to participate in
the RCM.</p>
<p>For the purposes of determining an NAQ for each Facility, using the
NAQ Model to be developed by AEMO in accordance with section 4.15, AEMO
will be required to determine a preliminary NAQ for each Facility and
then adjust (which can only be upwards in a subsequent step) that
preliminary NAQ as preliminary NAQs for other Facilities are
progressively determined in the priority order.</p>
<p><strong>Scenario 2 – there are nominated Fixed Price
Facilities</strong></p>
<p>The process for Scenario 2 is similar to Scenario 1 with some
modifications to reflect the existing priority order with respect to
Facilities that wish to receive a fixed Reserve Capacity Price.</p>
<p>Specifically, unless there is a shortfall in an Availability Class,
NAQs will be determined for Facilities wishing to receive a fixed
Reserve Capacity Price only if the NAQs determined for new market price
Facilities and existing capacity providers is less than the RCR +
3%.</p>
<p>Where there is a shortfall in an Availability Class, NAQs will be
determined for new Facilities that wish to receive a fixed Reserve
Capacity Price that are committed and proposed Facilities, in accordance
with a prioritisation order that includes other Facilities, until the
shortfall is fully covered or there are no Facilities left in the NAQ
Model without a preliminary NAQ (excluding Facilities where the
preliminary NAQ is less than the specified minimum quantity of Capacity
Credits for the facility to participate in the RCM).</p>
<p>However, Appendix 3 is also amended by the Miscellaneous Amendments
No. 1. As Appendix 3 is amended to reflect the amendments contained in
the Tranches 2 and 3 Amendments, as those amending rules (made by the
Minister at the date this companion version was prepared) will be

Appendix 3: Determination of Network Access Quantities

The objectives of this appendix are:

1.  To prevent AEMO determining Network Access Quantities (and assigning
    Capacity Credits) for Facilities that have been assigned Certified
    Reserve Capacity that have insufficient access to the Network and
    availability to usefully address the Reserve Capacity Requirement. A
    single algorithm is used for testing of Certified Reserve Capacity
    and for determining whether, in respect of a Reserve Capacity Cycle,
    a Network Access Quantity will be determined for any new Candidate
    Fixed Price Facilities for the current Reserve Capacity Cycle. The
    process is:

-   where the Facilities, for which Capacity Credits for the current
    > Reserve Capacity Cycle are being sought, do not include a
    > Candidate Fixed Price Facility, set out in Part A; and

-   where the Facilities, for which Capacity Credits for the current
    > Reserve Capacity Cycle are being sought, include a Candidate Fixed
    > Price Facility, set out in Part B.

Augmentation Funding Facility) or an Indicative NAQ for the Facility. A
Facility to which Early Certified Reserve Capacity has been assigned
will only be assigned a Final NAQ (and Capacity Credits) in Year 1 of
the RCC to which the application for Early Certified Reserve Capacity
relates, and subsequently receive the same treatment as other Facilities
holding Capacity Credits and a NAQ.</p></th>

<p>For the 2022 RCC, in which NAQs are to be first determined for
Facilities, AEMO must determine preliminary NAQs for existing and
committed Facilities that are not GIA Facilities, prior to determining
preliminary NAQs for all other Facilities in accordance with the
processes in this Appendix.</p>
<p>At Steps 3A, 3B and 3C, AEMO is required to determine a "preliminary
NAQ" for Facilities for which an NAQ was determined in the RCC
immediately preceding the current RCC, and for Early CRC Facilities
where the current RCC relates to the RCC in which the Facility's Reserve
Capacity will be delivered.</p>
<p>The intent of classifying the NAQ as "preliminary" is because as
other groups of Facilities are added to the NAQ Model and NAQs
determined for them in a subsequent step, an earlier NAQ determination
may need to be adjusted (upwards only). The intent is at the end of all
relevant steps, the preliminary NAQ (as may have been adjusted) is
recorded as the Final NAQ for the Facility. The Final NAQ for a Facility
determines the number of Capacity Credits assigned to the Facility for
the RCC.</p>
<p>The intent of Step 3A is for AEMO to determine a preliminary NAQ for
each Facility by assessing whether the existing NAQ determined for the
Facility in the RCC immediately preceding the current RCC is in order
for the current RCC (0 to min(CRC, current NAQ). In other words:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><blockquote>
<p>verify that the Facility has been assigned Certified Reserve Capacity
in the current RCC (equal to or greater than the NAQ determined for the
Facility in the RCC immediately preceding the current RCC; then</p>

lower than the NAQ in 1, reduce the NAQ to the amount specified to be
bilaterally traded for the Facility in the current RCC; then</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote>
<p>check whether there has been any organic changes in the network that
reduces the transfer capability of the network and, reduce the NAQ for
affected Facilities accordingly.</p>
</blockquote></li>
</ol>
<p>The intent of Steps 3B and 3C is for AEMO to determine whether there
is NAQ available to NAQ Facilities up to their Highest NAQ (PNAQ to
min(CRC, HNAQ)) and then up to the Certified Reserve Capacity assigned
to the Facility (PNAQ to CRC) respectively.</p>
<p>AEMO is also required to determine (and adjust (upwards only) in a
subsequent step) an Indicative NAQ for Early CRC Facilities (excluding
Early CRC Facilities that are also Network Augmented Funding Facilities)

Appendix 4A: Individual Intermittent Load Reserve Capacity Requirements

This Appendix describes how the Individual Intermittent Load Reserve
Capacity Requirement for Intermittent Load k for Trading Month n is
determined.

The Individual Intermittent Load Reserve Capacity Requirement is only to
be determined for Intermittent Loads that are and continue to be deemed
to be Intermittent Loads under clause 1.48.2.

Define:

-   MaxL(k) is the nominated load level for Intermittent Load k to apply
    for Trading Month n as specified in clause 4.28.8(c);

-   RM is the reserve margin for the Reserve Capacity Cycle defined as
    negative one plus the ratio of the Reserve Capacity Requirement for
    the relevant Capacity Year as described in clause 4.6.1 and the
    expected peak demand for the relevant Capacity Year as described in
    clause 4.6.2;

Calculate Req(k), which equals MaxL(k) multiplied by RM.

When setting the Individual Intermittent Load Reserve Capacity
Requirement for an Intermittent Load k for a Trading Month n in
accordance with Appendix 5:

-   If, at the time AEMO determines the Indicative Individual Reserve
    Capacity Requirements for Trading Month n, Intermittent Load k is
    registered and operating or AEMO reasonably expects it to be
    registered and operating during Trading Month n (based on
    information provided to AEMO in accordance with clause 4.28.8(c)),
    then set the Individual Intermittent Load Reserve Capacity
    Requirement for Intermittent Load k equal to Req(k).

-   If, at the time AEMO determines the Indicative Individual Reserve
    Capacity Requirements for Trading Month n, AEMO reasonably expects
    Intermittent Load k not to be registered or operating during Trading
    Month n (based on information provided to AEMO in accordance with
    clause 4.28.8(c)), then set the Individual Intermittent Load Reserve
    Capacity Requirement for Intermittent Load k equal to zero.

Appendix 5: Individual Reserve Capacity Requirements

This Appendix presents the method that must be used by AEMO to
determine, for a Trading Month n:

-   Individual Reserve Capacity Requirement Contributions as required
    for the determination of Relevant Demands under clause 4.26.2CA;

-   Indicative Individual Reserve Capacity Requirements as required
    under clause 4.28.6;

-   Individual Reserve Capacity Requirements as required under clause
    4.28.7; and

-   revised Individual Reserve Capacity Requirements as required under
    clause 4.28.11A.

AEMO must perform Steps 1 to 10A to determine the Indicative Individual
Reserve Capacity Requirements, Individual Reserve Capacity Requirements
or revised Individual Reserve Capacity Requirements for Trading Month n.

AEMO must perform Step 11 as required to determine the Individual
Reserve Capacity Requirement Contribution of an individual metered
Associated Load for Trading Month n, using as input the relevant values
calculated by AEMO when it determined the Indicative Individual Reserve
Capacity Requirements for Trading Month n.

For the purpose of this Appendix:

1\. All references, apart from those in Step 5A, to meters are interval
meters.

2\. The Notional Wholesale Meter is to be treated as a registered
interval meter measuring Temperature Dependent Load. This meter is
denoted by Temperature Dependent Load meter v=v\*.

3\. The New Notional Wholesale Meter, determined in accordance with Step
5A, is to be treated as a registered interval meter measuring
Temperature Dependent Load.

4\. A meter measuring a Facility containing an Intermittent Load, that
is and continues to be deemed to be an Intermittent Load under clause
1.48.2, is to be included in these calculations as if it were two
meters, one representing the Intermittent Load and included in the set
indexed by w, and one representing other load at the Facility and
included in the set indexed by u or v as applicable, with metered
consumption calculated according to clause 2.30B.10 and clause 11 of
this Appendix 5.

5\. A meter measuring a Facility containing an Intermittent Load, for
which an application was approved under clause 2.30B.6 on or after New
WEM Commencement Day, is to be included in these calculations as a
single meter representing a Non-Dispatchable Load and included in the
set indexed by u or v as applicable, with metered consumption calculated
according to clause 2.30B.11 and clause 12 of this Appendix 5.

6\. The meter registration data to be used in the calculations is to be
the most current complete set of meter registration data as at the time
of commencing the calculations.

7\. The 12 Peak SWIS Trading Intervals to be used in the calculations
are the 12 Peak SWIS Trading Intervals determined and published by AEMO
under clause 4.1.23A for the Hot Season preceding the start of the
Capacity Year in which Trading Month n falls (the “preceding Hot
Season”).

8\. The 4 Peak SWIS Trading Intervals for a Trading Month to be used in
the calculations are the 4 Peak SWIS Trading Intervals determined and
published by AEMO under clause 4.1.23B for that Trading Month.

9\. When calculating the Indicative Individual Reserve Capacity
Requirements it is assumed that all meters registered to a Market
Participant on the day of calculation will remain registered to that
Market Participant for the entirety of Trading Month n.

10\. A meter measuring a Scheduled Facility, Semi-Scheduled Facility or
Non-Scheduled Facility not containing an Intermittent Load is to be
included in these calculations and included in the set indexed by u or v
as applicable, with metered consumption calculated in accordance with
clause 12 of this Appendix 5.

11\. Each meter measuring an Aggregated Facility is to be included as a
separate meter and included in the set indexed by u or v as applicable,
with metered consumption calculated in accordance with clause 12 of this
Appendix 5.

12\. Metered consumption for meter m, in Trading Interval t, is zero
when AEMO issues a direction under clause 7.7.5 in respect of an
Electric Storage Resource associated with m for a Dispatch Interval
within t, otherwise it is -1 x min(0, SOMS(m, t)), where SOMS(m, t) is
the Sent Out Metered Schedule of m in t.

Step 1: Calculate:

RR = min(RCR, CC)

FL = FL\_RCR × RR / RCR

where:

RCR is the Reserve Capacity Requirement for the relevant Reserve
Capacity Cycle

CC is the total number of Capacity Credits assigned for Trading Month n
at the time of the calculation

FL\_RCR is the peak demand associated with the Reserve Capacity
Requirement for the relevant Reserve Capacity Cycle as specified in
clause 4.6.2

Step 2: For each meter, u, measuring Non-Temperature Dependent Load that
was registered with AEMO for all of the 12 Peak SWIS Trading Intervals
determine NTDL(u), where:

> NTDL(u) is the contribution to the system peak load of meter u during
> the preceding Hot Season where this contribution is double the median
> value of the metered consumption during the 12 Peak SWIS Trading
> Intervals

Step 3: For each meter, v, measuring Temperature Dependent Load that was
registered with AEMO for all of the 12 Peak SWIS Trading Intervals
determine TDL(v), where:

> TDL(v) is the contribution to the system peak load of meter v during
> the preceding Hot Season where this contribution is double the median
> value of the metered consumption during the 12 Peak SWIS Trading
> Intervals

Step 4: For each Intermittent Load meter w set its Individual
Intermittent Load Reserve Capacity Requirement, IILRCR(w), to equal the
amount defined in accordance with Appendix 4A.

Step 5: Identify meters that were not registered with AEMO during one or
more of the 12 Peak SWIS Trading Intervals but which were registered by
the end of Trading Month n.

> For a new meter u that measures Non-Temperature Dependent Load set
> NMNTCR(u) to be 1.1 times the MW figure formed by doubling the median
> value of the metered consumption for that meter during the 4 Peak SWIS
> Trading Intervals of Trading Month n-3.
>
> For a new meter v that measures Temperature Dependent Load set
> NMTDCR(v) to be 1.3 times the MW figure formed by doubling the median
> value of the metered consumption for that meter during the 4 Peak SWIS
> Trading Intervals of Trading Month n-3.

Step 5A:

> Find the MW figure formed by doubling the median value of the metered
> consumption for the Notional Wholesale Meter v\*, during the 4 Peak
> SWIS Trading Intervals of Trading Month n-3 (“Median Notional
> Wholesale Meter”).
>
> Divide the Median Notional Wholesale Meter by the number of
> non-interval or accumulation meters that existed at the end of Trading
> Month n-3 (“Average Non - Interval Meter”).
>
> Subtract the number of non-interval or accumulation meters
> disconnected between the end of the preceding Hot Season and the end
> of Trading Month n-3 from the number of non-interval or accumulation
> meters connected between the end of the preceding Hot Season and the
> end of Trading Month n-3 (“Non-Interval Meter Growth”).
>
> Multiply the Non-Interval Meter Growth and the Average Non-Interval
> Meter. (“New Notional Wholesale Meter”).
>
> For the New Notional Wholesale Meter set NMTDCR(v) equal to be 1.3
> times the New Notional Wholesale Meter.

Step 6: Calculate the values of d(u,i) for Non-Temperature Dependent
Load, d(v,i) for Temperature Dependent Loads and d(w,i) for Intermittent
Loads such that:

-   d(u,i) has a value of zero if meter u measures Intermittent Load or
    was not registered to Market Participant i during Trading Month n,
    otherwise it has a value equal to the number of full Trading Days
    the meter was registered to Market Participant i in Trading Month n
    divided by the number of days in Trading Month n.

-   d(v,i) has a value of zero if meter v measures Intermittent Load or
    was not registered to Market Participant i during Trading Month n,
    otherwise it has a value equal to the number of full Trading Days
    the meter was registered to Market Participant i in Trading Month n
    divided by the number of days in Trading Month n.

-   d(w,i) has a value of zero if meter w was not registered to Market
    Participant i during Trading Month n, otherwise it has a value of
    one if Market Participant i nominated capacity for the Intermittent
    Load measured by meter w in accordance with clause 4.28.8(c), with
    the exception that if the Intermittent Load was for Load at a meter
    registered to Market Participant i for only part of Trading Month n,
    then it has a value equal to the number of full Trading Days that
    meter was registered to Market Participant i in Trading Month n
    divided by the number of days in Trading Month n.

Step 7: Identify the set NM of all those new meters v that measured
consumption that was measured by meter v=v\* during the preceding Hot
Season and set TDLn(v) for meter v=v\* to equal:

> TDLn(v\*) = TDL(v\*) – Sum(v∈NM, NMTDCR(v))

Step 8: For each Market Participant i, calculate:

> ILRCR(i) = Sum(IILRCR(w) × d(w,i))

Step 8A: Calculate:

> NRR = RR – Sum(i, ILRCR(i))
>
> NTDL\_Ratio = NRR / FL

Step 8B: For each Market Participant i, calculate:

> NTDLRCR(i) = Sum(NTDL(u) × d(u,i)) × NTDL\_Ratio

Step 8C: Calculate:

> TDL\_Ratio = (NRR ‑ Sum(i, NTDLRCR(i))) /  
> Sum(i, Sum(MTDL(v) × d(v,i)))
>
> where
>
> MTDL(v) = TDL(v) for all v except v\* and  
> MTDL(v) = TDLn(v\*) for v=v\*

Step 8D: For each Market Participant i, calculate:

> TDLRCR(i) = (Sum MTDL(v) × d(v,i)) × TDL\_Ratio

Step 9: For each Market Participant i, calculate

> X(i) = Sum(i, ILRCR(i) + NTDLRCR(i) + TDLRCR(i)) + Sum(u, NMNTCR(u) ×
> d(u,i)) + Sum(v, NMTDCR(v) × d(v,i))

Step 10: Calculate:

> Total\_Ratio = RR / Sum(i, X(i))

Step 10A: For each Market Participant i, set the Indicative Individual
Reserve Capacity Requirement or Individual Reserve Capacity Requirement,
as applicable, for Trading Month n to:

> X(i) × Total\_Ratio

Step 11: The Individual Reserve Capacity Requirement Contribution of an
individual metered Associated Load for Trading Month n of a Capacity
Year is determined as follows:

> \(a\) for meter u at a connection point measuring Non-Temperature
> Dependent Load that was registered with AEMO for all of the 12 Peak
> SWIS Trading Intervals equals (NTDL(u) x NTDL\_Ratio x Total\_Ratio);
>
> \(b\) for meter v at a connection point measuring Temperature
> Dependent Load that was registered with AEMO for all of the 12 Peak
> SWIS Trading Intervals equals (TDL(v) x TDL\_Ratio x Total\_Ratio);
>
> \(c\) for meter u at a new connection point identified in Step 5
> measuring Non-Temperature Dependent Load equals (NMNTCR(u) x
> Total\_Ratio); and
>
> \(d\) for meter v at a new connection point identified in Step 5
> measuring Temperature Dependent Load equals (NMTDCR(v) x
> Total\_Ratio).

Appendix 5A: Non-Temperature Dependent Load Requirements

This Appendix specifies how AEMO must determine whether or not to accept
a Load measured by an interval meter nominated in accordance with
clauses 4.28.8(a) or 4.28.8C as a Non-Temperature Dependent Load for the
purposes of clause 4.28.9.

For the purpose of this Appendix:

-   AEMO must use the current set of meter data (as at the time when it
    commences its calculations);

-   the 4 Peak SWIS Trading Intervals in a Trading Month are the 4 Peak
    SWIS Trading Intervals determined and published by AEMO under clause
    4.1.23B for that Trading Month; and

    AEMO must treat each connection point measured by an interval meter
    measuring a Scheduled Facility, Semi-Scheduled Facility or
    Non‑Scheduled Facility as if it were a separate Non-Dispatchable
    Load.

AEMO must perform the following steps (in sequential order) when
determining whether or not to accept a Load measured by an interval
meter nominated in accordance with clauses 4.28.8(a) or 4.28.8C as a
Non-Temperature Dependent Load for the purposes of clause 4.28.9:

Step 1:

-   If, in accordance with clause 4.28.8(a), the Market Participant
    provides AEMO in Trading Month n-2 with the identity of an interval
    meter associated with that Market Participant which measures a Load
    that it nominates as a Non-Temperature Dependent Load from Trading
    Month n;

-   If the identity of the interval meter is provided by the date and
    time specified in clause 4.1.23; and

-   If the Load was treated as a Non-Temperature Dependent Load in
    Trading Month n-8,

then AEMO must accept the Load as a Non-Temperature Dependent Load if:

\(a\) the median value of the metered consumption for the Load,
calculated for the set of Trading Intervals defined as the 4 Peak SWIS
Trading Intervals in each of the Trading Months starting from the start
of Trading Month n-11 to the end of Trading Month n-3, exceeded 1.0 MWh;
and

\(b\) the metered consumption for the Load did not deviate downwards
from the median value in paragraph (a) by more than 10% for more than
10% of the time during the period from the start of Trading Month n-11
to the end of Trading Month n-3, except during Trading Intervals for
which:

i\. the metered consumption was 0 MWh; or

ii\. consumption was reduced at the request of AEMO; or

iii\. AEMO has accepted a Consumption Deviation Application for the Load
under clause 4.28.9D.

Step 2:

-   If, in accordance with clauses 4.28.8(a) or 4.28.8C, the Market
    Participant provides AEMO in Trading Month n-2 with the identity of
    an interval meter associated with that Market Participant which
    measures a Load that it nominates as a Non-Temperature Dependent
    Load from Trading Month n;

-   If the Load was not treated as a Non-Temperature Dependent Load in
    Trading Month n-1; and

-   If the Load was not treated as a Non-Temperature Dependent Load for
    any of the Trading Months in the Capacity Year in which Trading
    Month n falls,

then AEMO must accept the Load as a Non-Temperature Dependent Load for
Trading Month n if:

\(a\) the median value of the metered consumption for the Load during
the 4 Peak SWIS Trading Intervals in Trading Month n-3 exceeded 1.0 MWh;
and

\(b\) the metered consumption for the Load did not deviate downwards
from the median value in paragraph (a) by more than 10% for more than
10% of the time during Trading Month n-3, except during Trading
Intervals for which:

i\. the metered consumption was 0 MWh; or

ii consumption was reduced at the request of AEMO; or

iii\. AEMO has accepted a Consumption Deviation Application for the Load
under clause 4.28.9D.

Step 3:

-   If a Load was not accepted under Step 1 as a Non-Temperature
    Dependent Load for Trading Month n; and

-   If the Load was accepted under Step 2, or previously under this Step
    3, as a Non-Temperature Dependent Load for Trading Month n-1,

then AEMO must accept the Load as a Non-Temperature Dependent Load for
Trading Month n if:

\(a\) the median value of the metered consumption for the Load,
calculated for the set of Trading Intervals defined as the 4 Peak SWIS
Trading Intervals in each of the Trading Months commencing at the start
of the Trading Month for which metered consumption was used by AEMO to
accept the Load as a Non-Temperature Dependent Load under Step 2 to the
end of Trading Month n-3, exceeded 1.0 MWh; and

\(b\) the metered consumption for the Load did not deviate downwards
from the median value in paragraph (a) by more than 10% for more than
10% of the time during the period from the start of the Trading Month
for which metered consumption was used by AEMO to accept the Load as a
Non-Temperature Dependent Load under Step 2 to the end of Trading Month
n-3, except during Trading Intervals for which:

i\. the metered consumption was 0 MWh; or

ii\. consumption was reduced at the request of AEMO; or

iii\. AEMO has accepted a Consumption Deviation Application for the Load
under clause 4.28.9D.

Step 4:

Otherwise, AEMO must treat a Load as a Temperature Dependent Load.

Appendix 6: STEM Price Curve Determination

The first part of this appendix describes a process for converting a
Market Participant’s Portfolio Supply Curve and Portfolio Demand Curve
into a single STEM Price Curve and to then convert a Market
Participant’s STEM Price Curve into STEM Bids and STEM Offers relative
to its Net Bilateral Position.

For each Market Participant and for each Trading Interval in the Trading
Day except those for which AEMO has recorded that the Market Participant
has not made a STEM Submission:

\(a\) Determine for every price between the Energy Offer Price Floor and
the Energy Offer Price Ceiling:

i\. the maximum cumulative quantity the Market Participant is prepared
to sell into the STEM from all of its Price-Quantity Pairs in its
Portfolio Supply Curve;

ii\. the minimum cumulative quantity the Market Participant is prepared
to sell into the STEM from all of its Price-Quantity Pairs in its
Portfolio Supply Curve;

iii\. the maximum cumulative quantity the Market Participant is prepared
to buy from the STEM from all of its Price-Quantity Pairs in its
Portfolio Demand Curve;

iv\. the minimum cumulative quantity the Market Participant is prepared
to buy from the STEM from all of its Price-Quantity Pairs in its
Portfolio Demand Curve;

v\. the STEM Price Curve quantity for that price where:

1\. the minimum STEM Price Curve quantity for that price equals the
value in Appendix 6(a)(ii) less the value in Appendix 6(a)(iii);

2\. the maximum STEM Price Curve quantity for that price equals the
value in Appendix 6(a)(i) less the value in Appendix 6(a)(iv); and

3\. the STEM Price Curve for that price includes all quantities between
those in Appendix 6(a)(v)(1) and Appendix 6(a)(v)(2).

\(b\) If the minimum of the quantities determined under Appendix
6(a)(v)(1) for the Market Participant for the Trading Interval is
greater than the Net Bilateral Position of the Market Participant in the
Trading Interval then:

i\. if, for every price between the Energy Offer Price Floor and the
Energy Offer Price Ceiling, the quantity determined under Appendix
6(a)(v)(1) is equal to the quantity determined under Appendix
6(a)(v)(2), then amend the STEM Price Curve for the Energy Offer Price
Floor to include all quantities between the Net Bilateral Position of
the Market Participant and the quantity determined for the Energy Offer
Price Floor under Appendix 6(a)(v)(2); and

ii\. otherwise, amend the STEM Price Curve for the lowest price for
which the quantity determined under Appendix 6(a)(v)(1) is not equal to
the quantity determined under Appendix 6(a)(v)(2), to include all
quantities between the Net Bilateral Position of the Market Participant
and the quantity determined for the price under Appendix 6(a)(v)(2).

\(c\) If the maximum of the quantities determined under Appendix
6(a)(v)(2) for the Market Participant for the Trading Interval is less
than the Net Bilateral Position of the Market Participant then:

i\. if, for every price between the Energy Offer Price Floor and the
Energy Offer Price Ceiling, the quantity determined under Appendix
6(a)(v)(1) is equal to the quantity determined under Appendix
6(a)(v)(2), then amend the STEM Price Curve for the Energy Offer Price
Ceiling to include all quantities between the quantity determined for
the Energy Offer Price Ceiling under Appendix 6(a)(v)(1) and the Net
Bilateral Position of the Market Participant; and

ii\. otherwise, amend the STEM Price Curve for the highest price for
which the quantity determined under Appendix 6(a)(v)(1) is not equal to
the quantity determined under Appendix 6(a)(v)(2), to include all
quantities between the quantity determined for the price under Appendix
6(a)(v)(1) and the Net Bilateral Position of the Market Participant.

\(d\) If the Net Bilateral Position equals the minimum STEM Price Curve
quantity then there are no STEM Bids, otherwise:

i\. for the STEM Price Curve between the minimum STEM Price Curve
quantity and the Net Bilateral Position of that Market Participant
identify each price for which more than one STEM Price Curve quantity is
defined;

ii\. for each price identified in Appendix 6(d)(i) identify the minimum
STEM Price Curve quantity for which that price applies, such that the
STEM Price Curve quantity lies between the minimum STEM Price Curve
quantity and the Net Bilateral Position;

iii\. for each price identified in Appendix 6(d)(i) identify the maximum
STEM Price Curve quantity for which that price applies, such that the
STEM Price Curve quantity lies between the minimum STEM Price Curve
quantity and the Net Bilateral Position;

iv\. for each price identified in Appendix 6(d)(i) set a Price-Quantity
Pair price equal to that price;

v\. for each price identified in Appendix 6(d)(i) set a Price-Quantity
Pair quantity equal to the quantity defined in Appendix 6(d)(iii) less
the quantity defined in Appendix 6(d)(ii); and

vi\. set the Market Participant’s STEM Bids to be the set of
Price-Quantity Pairs defined in Appendix 6(d)(iv) and Appendix 6(d)(v)
where each Price-Quantity Pair means that the Market Participant is
prepared to buy a quantity of energy from the STEM for that
Price-Quantity Pair equal to:

1\. 0 MWh if the STEM Clearing Price is greater than the Price-Quantity
Pair price;

2\. the Price-Quantity Pair quantity if the STEM Clearing Price is less
than the Price-Quantity Pair price; and

3\. an amount between 0 MWh and the Price-Quantity Pair quantity if the
STEM Clearing Price equals the Price-Quantity Pair price.

\(e\) If the Net Bilateral Position equals the maximum STEM Price Curve
quantity then there are no STEM Offers, otherwise:

i\. for the STEM Price Curve between the Net Bilateral Position of that
Market Participant and the maximum STEM Price Curve quantity identify
each price for which more than one STEM Price Curve quantity is defined;

ii\. for each price identified in Appendix 6(e)(i) identify the minimum
STEM Price Curve quantity for which that price applies, such that the
STEM Price Curve quantity lies between the Net Bilateral Position and
the maximum STEM Price Curve quantity;

iii\. for each price identified in Appendix 6(e)(i) identify the maximum
STEM Price Curve quantity for which that price applies, such that the
STEM Price Curve quantity lies between the minimum STEM Price Curve
quantity and the Net Bilateral Position;

iv\. for each price identified in Appendix 6(e)(i) set a Price-Quantity
Pair price equal to that price;

v\. for each price identified in Appendix 6(e)(i) set a Price-Quantity
Pair quantity equal to the quantity defined in Appendix 6(e)(iii) less

Appendix 9: Relevant Level Determination

Part A: Introduction

Interpretations and Definitions

A.1. This Appendix 9 presents the methodology for determining the
Relevant Levels for Candidate Facilities for a given Reserve Capacity
Cycle.

A.2. In this Appendix 9:

\(a\) a Candidate Facility is a Facility, or a component of a Facility,
for which:

i\. a Market Participant has applied for:

1\. Certified Reserve Capacity for the relevant Reserve Capacity Cycle
under section 4.9;

2\. Conditional Certified Reserve Capacity for a future Reserve Capacity
Cycle under section 4.9, where AEMO is required under clause 4.9.7A to
process the application at the time it processes applications for
Certified Reserve Capacity for the relevant Reserve Capacity Cycle; or

3\. Early Certified Reserve Capacity for a Reserve Capacity Cycle under
clause 4.28C.2, where AEMO is required to process the application at the
time it processes applications for Certified Reserve Capacity for the
relevant Reserve Capacity Cycle;

ii\. the Market Participant’s application includes all supporting
information required under section 4.10 or clause 4.28C.5 (as
applicable); and

iii\. the Certified Reserve Capacity, Conditional Certified Reserve
Capacity or Early Certified Reserve Capacity (as applicable) is required
to be determined in accordance with clause 4.11.2(b);

\(b\) the full operation date of a Candidate Facility for the relevant
Reserve Capacity Cycle (“Full Operation Date”) is:

i\. the date provided under clause 4.10.1(c)(iii)(7) or revised in
accordance with clause 4.27.11A, where at the time the application for
certification of Reserve Capacity is made the Candidate Facility is yet
to enter service; or

ii\. the date most recently provided for a Reserve Capacity Cycle under
clause 4.10.1(k) otherwise; and

\(c\) a Candidate Facility will be considered to be:

i\. a new Candidate Facility if the five-year period identified in
Step 1(a) of this Appendix 9 commenced before 8:00 AM on the Full
Operation Date for the Facility (“New Candidate Facility”); or

ii\. an existing Candidate Facility (“Existing Candidate Facility”)
otherwise.

A.3. AEMO must determine the Relevant Levels for Candidate Facilities
for a given Reserve Capacity Cycle by following each of the steps set
out in Part B of this Appendix 9.

Part B: Process Steps

### ***Determining Existing Facility Load for Scheduled Generation***

Step 1: Identify:

\(a\) the five year period ending at 8:00 AM on 1 April of Capacity Year
1 of the relevant Reserve Capacity Cycle;

\(b\) any 12 month period, from 1 April to 31 March, occurring during
the five year period identified in Step 1(a), where the 12 Trading
Intervals with the highest Existing Facility Load for Scheduled
Generation in that 12 month period have not previously been determined
under this Appendix 9; and

\(c\) any 12 month period, from 1 April to 31 March, occurring during
the five year period identified in Step 1(a), where the 12 Trading
Intervals with the highest Existing Facility Load for Scheduled
Generation in that 12 month period have previously been determined under
this Appendix 9.

Step 2: Determine the quantity of electricity (in MWh) sent out by each
Candidate Facility:

\(a\) using Facility Sub-Metering, where the Candidate Facility is a
component of a Facility for which Facility Sub-Metering is required to
be installed; and

\(b\) using Sent Out Metered Schedules, where the Candidate Facility is
not a component of a Facility for which Facility Sub-Metering is
required to be installed,

for each of the Trading Intervals in the period identified in Step 1(b).

Step 3: For each Candidate Facility, identify any Trading Intervals in
the period identified in Step 1(b) where:

\(a\) the Candidate Facility, other than a Facility in the Balancing
Portfolio, was directed to restrict its output under a Dispatch
Instruction as provided in a schedule under clause 7.13.1(c); or

\(b\) the Candidate Facility, if in the Balancing Portfolio, was
instructed by AEMO to deviate from its Dispatch Plan or change its
commitment or output as provided in a schedule under clause 7.13.1C(d);
or

\(c\) the Candidate Facility was affected by a Consequential Outage; or

\(d\) the Candidate Facility was directed to restrict its output under
an Operating Instruction issued in accordance with a NCESS Contract, as
provided in a schedule under clause 7.13.1(cC).

Step 4: For each Candidate Facility and Trading Interval identified in
Step 3(a):

\(a\) identify the actual quantity as determined in Step 2 if:

i\. AEMO has made a revised estimate of the maximum quantity in
accordance with clause 7.7.5A(c) and the WEM Procedure specified in
clause 7.7.5A; and

ii\. the revised estimate of the maximum quantity is lower than the
actual quantity as determined in Step 2;

\(b\) identify the actual quantity as determined in Step 2 if:

i\. Step 4(a) does not apply; and

ii\. the estimated maximum quantity determined by AEMO under clause
7.13.1(eF) is lower than the actual quantity as determined in Step 2;
and

\(c\) if Steps 4(a) and 4(b) do not apply:

i\. identify the revised estimate of the maximum quantity determined by
AEMO in accordance with the WEM Procedure specified in clause 7.7.5A; or

ii\. if there is no revised estimate, identify the estimate determined
by AEMO under clause 7.13.1(eF).

Step 5: For each Candidate Facility and Trading Interval identified in
Step 3(b) use:

\(a\) the estimate recorded by AEMO under clause 7.13.1C(e); and

\(b\) the quantity determined for the Candidate Facility and Trading
Interval in Step 2,

to estimate the quantity of energy (in MWh) that would have been sent
out by the Candidate Facility had it not complied with AEMO’s
instruction to change its commitment or output during the Trading
Interval.

Step 6: For each Candidate Facility and Trading Interval identified in
Step 3(c) use:

\(a\) the Unadjusted Consequential Outage Quantity for the Candidate
Facility for the Trading Interval;

\(b\) the quantity determined for the Candidate Facility and Trading
Interval in Step 2; and

\(c\) the information recorded by AEMO under clause 7.13.1C(a),

to estimate the quantity of energy (in MWh) that would have been sent
out by the Candidate Facility had it not been affected by the
Consequential Outage during the Trading Interval.

Step 6A: For each Candidate Facility and Trading Interval identified in
Step 3(d) use:

\(a\) the schedule of Operating Instructions determined by AEMO under
clause 7.13.1(cC);

\(b\) the quantity determined for the Candidate Facility and Trading
Interval in Step 2; and

\(c\) the information recorded by AEMO under clause 7.13.1C(a),

to estimate the quantity of energy (in MWh) that would have been sent
out by the Candidate Facility had it not been subject to an Operating
Instruction during the Trading Interval.

Step 7: Determine for each Trading Interval in each 12 month period
identified in Step 1(b) the Existing Facility Load for Scheduled
Generation (in MWh) as:

(Total\_Generation + DSP\_Reduction + Interruptible\_Reduction +
Involuntary\_Reduction) – CF\_Generation

where

Total\_Generation is the Total Sent Out Generation of all Registered
Facilities;

DSP\_Reduction is the total quantity of Deemed DSM Dispatch for all
Demand Side Programmes for that Trading Interval;

Interruptible\_Reduction is the total quantity by which all
Interruptible Loads reduced their consumption in accordance with the
terms of an Ancillary Service Contract, as recorded by AEMO under clause
7.13.1C(c);

Involuntary\_Reduction is the total quantity of energy not served due to
involuntary load shedding (manual and automatic), as recorded by AEMO
under clause 7.13.1C(b); and

CF\_Generation is the total sent out generation of all Candidate
Facilities, as determined in Step 2 or estimated in Steps 4, 5, 6 or 6A
as applicable.

Step 8: Determine for each 12 month period identified in Step 1(b) the
12 Trading Intervals, occurring on separate Trading Days, with the
highest Existing Facility Load for Scheduled Generation.

Step 9: Identify, for each 12 month period identified in Step 1(c), the
following:

\(a\) the Existing Facility Load for Scheduled Generation previously
determined under this Appendix 9 for each Trading Interval in the 12
month period;

\(b\) subject to Step 9A, the sent out generation (in MWh) for each
Candidate Facility and for each Trading Interval in that 12 month
period, where that sent out generation was used to determine the
CF\_Generation (which is one of the variables used to determine the
Existing Facility Load for Scheduled Generation in Step 7) for that
Trading Interval; and

\(c\) the 12 Trading Intervals occurring on separate Trading Days that
were previously determined to have the highest Existing Facility Load
for Scheduled Generation in the 12 month period.

Step 9A: For the purposes of Step 9(b), if:

\(a\) AEMO has determined a revised estimate of the maximum quantity in
accordance with the WEM Procedure specified in clause 7.7.5A;

\(b\) the revised estimate relates to a Candidate Facility and a Trading
Interval in a 12 month period identified in Step 1(c); and

\(c\) AEMO determined the sent out generation for that Candidate
Facility and for that Trading Interval in accordance with Step 4 before
it revised the estimate,

then AEMO must redetermine the sent out generation for that Candidate
Facility and that Trading Interval in accordance with Step 4.

### ***Determining New Facility Load for Scheduled Generation***

Step 10: For each New Candidate Facility determine, for each Trading
Interval in the period identified in Step 1(a) that falls before 8:00 AM
on the Full Operation Date for the Candidate Facility, an estimate of
the quantity of energy (in MWh) that would have been sent out by the
Candidate Facility in the Trading Interval, if it had been in operation
with the configuration proposed under clause 4.10.1(dA) in the relevant
application for certification of Reserve Capacity. The estimates must
reflect the estimates in the expert report provided for the Candidate
Facility under clause 4.10.3, unless AEMO reasonably considers the
estimates in the expert report to be inaccurate.

Step11: For each New Candidate Facility determine, for each Trading
Interval in the period identified in Step 1(a), the New Facility Load
for Scheduled Generation (in MWh) as:

\(a\) if the Trading Interval falls before 8:00 AM on the Full Operation
Date for the Facility:

EFLSG + Actual\_CF\_Generation – Estimated\_CF\_Generation

where

EFLSG is the Existing Facility Load for Scheduled Generation for the
Trading Interval, determined in Step 7 or identified in Step 9(a) as
applicable;

Actual\_CF\_Generation is the sent out generation of the New Candidate
Facility for the Trading Interval, as identified in Step 9(b),
determined in Step 2 or estimated in Steps 4, 5, 6 or 6A as applicable;
and

Estimated\_CF\_Generation is the quantity determined for the New
Candidate Facility and the Trading Interval in Step 10;

or

\(b\) the Existing Facility Load for Scheduled Generation for the
Trading Interval, otherwise.

Step 12: For each New Candidate Facility determine, for each 12 month
period identified in Step 1(a), the 12 Trading Intervals, occurring on
separate Trading Days, with the highest New Facility Load for Scheduled
Generation.

### ***Determining the Facility Average Performance Level***

Step 13: For each Existing Candidate Facility, determine the 60
quantities comprising:

\(a\) the MWh quantities determined in Step 2 or estimated in Steps 4,
5, 6 or 6A as applicable for each of the Trading Intervals determined in
Step 8, multiplied by 2 to convert to units of MW; and

\(b\) the MWh quantities determined in Step 9(b) for each of the Trading
Intervals identified in Step 9(c), multiplied by 2 to convert to units
of MW.

Step 14: For each New Candidate Facility, determine the 60 quantities
comprising:

\(a\) the MWh quantities identified in Step 9(b), determined in Step 2
or estimated in Steps 4, 5, 6 or 6A as applicable for each of the
Trading Intervals identified in Step 12 that fall after 8:00 AM on the
Full Operation Date for the Candidate Facility, multiplied by 2 to
convert to units of MW; and

\(b\) the MWh quantities determined in Step 10 for each of the Trading
Intervals identified in Step 12 that fall before 8:00 AM on the Full
Operation Date of the Candidate Facility, multiplied by 2 to convert to
units of MW.

Step 15: Determine the average performance level (in MW) for each
Candidate Facility f (“Facility Average Performance Level”) as the mean
of the 60 quantities determined for Candidate Facility f in Step 13 or
Step 14 as applicable.

### ***Determine the Facility Adjustment Factor***

Step 16: Determine the variance (in MW) for each Candidate Facility f
(“Facility Variance”) as the variance of the MW quantities determined
for Candidate Facility f in Step 13 or Step 14 as applicable.

Step 17: Determine the facility adjustment factor (in MW) for each
Candidate Facility f (“Facility Adjustment Factor”) in accordance with
the following formula:

Facility Adjustment Factor = min(G x Facility Variance (f), Facility
Average Performance Level (f) / 3 + K x Facility Variance (f))

Where

G = K + U / Facility Average Performance Level (f)

K is determined in accordance with the following table:

### ***Determining the Relevant Level for a Candidate Facility***

Step 18: Determine the Relevant Level for each Candidate Facility f (in
MW) in accordance with the following formula:

Relevant Level (f) = max(0, Facility Average Performance Level (f) -
Facility Adjustment Factor (f))

### ***Publication of information***

Step 19: Publish on the WEM Website by 1 June of Year 1 of the relevant
Reserve Capacity Cycle on a provisional basis:

\(a\) a forecast of the Trading Intervals that may be identified in Step
8; and

\(b\) a forecast of the Existing Facility Load for Scheduled Generation
quantities that may be determined in Step 7.

Step 20: Publish on the WEM Website within three Business Days after the
date specified in clause 4.1.11 (as modified or extended) for the
relevant Reserve Capacity Cycle:

\(a\) the Trading Intervals identified in Step 8; and

\(b\) the Existing Facility Load for Scheduled Generation quantities
determined in Step 7.

Step 21: Publish on the WEM Website the following information identified
for a Reserve Capacity Cycle under the Relevant Level Methodology:

\(a\) the Existing Facility Load for Scheduled Generation for each
Trading Interval in the five year period determined under Step 1(a) of
Appendix 9; and

\(b\) the 12 Trading Intervals occurring on separate Trading Days with
the highest Existing Facility Load for Scheduled Generation for each 12
month period in the five year period.

Appendix 10: Relevant Demand Determination

This Appendix sets out the 5th percentile methodology for determining
the Relevant Demand for each Demand Side Programme, for use in clause
4.26.2CA(a).

The Relevant Demand value is to be re-calculated for each Demand Side
Programme for each Trading Day.

### **Step 1**

Identify the 200 Calendar Hours in the previous Capacity Year with the
highest Total Sent Out Generation. The Calendar Hours do not have to be
contiguous.

### **Step 2**

For each Demand Side Programme, for each Calendar Hour identified in
Step 1, for each of the Demand Side Programme’s Associated Loads,
identify the quantity (expressed in MWh)[4] equal to—

\(a\) unless paragraphs (b) or (c) apply, the Associated Load’s metered
consumption for the two Trading Intervals in the Calendar Hour; or

\(b\) unless paragraph (c) applies, if the Associated Load’s metered
consumption is not available or is considered by AEMO to be
inappropriate, a quantity determined by AEMO based on—

i\. available Meter Data Submissions; or

ii\. Load information provided by the Market Participant; or

iii\. other relevant information; or

\(c\) if AEMO has accepted a Consumption Deviation Application for the
Associated Load under clause 4.26.2CB(b), AEMO’s estimate of what the
consumption of the Associated Load would have been if it had not been
affected.

### **Step 3**

For each Demand Side Programme, for each Calendar Hour identified in
Step 1, sum the values determined under Step 2 across all the Demand
Side Programme’s Associated Loads.

### **Step 4**

For each Demand Side Programme, rank the 200 values determined under
Step 3 from lowest to highest.

The Demand Side Programme’s Relevant Demand is the tenth lowest value.

Appendix 12: Transmission Connected Generating System Generator
Performance Standards

This Appendix lists each of the Technical Requirements for Transmission
Connected Generating Systems and sets out the Ideal Generator
Performance Standard, Minimum Generator Performance Standard and any
applicable Common Requirements for each Technical Requirement.

Each Technical Requirement may specify Negotiation Criteria which must
be met if a Market Participant responsible for a Transmission Connected
Generating System submits a Proposed Negotiated Generator Performance
Standard.

If a Technical Requirement specifies Common Requirements, these apply
whether an Ideal Generator Performance Standard or Negotiated Generator
Performance Standard is intended to apply to a Transmission Connected
Generating System in respect of a Technical Requirement.

### **Use of defined terms in this Appendix 12**

Terms defined in Part A12.1 of this Appendix 12 are defined for the
purposes of this Appendix alone and must not be used to infer the
meaning of those words, or other words, in these WEM Rules. Terms which
are defined in these WEM Rules will apply to this Appendix unless
defined in this Appendix or the context otherwise requires.

Where the terms Scheduled Generator and Non-Scheduled Generator are used
in this Appendix, in relation to generating works that are proposed to
be connected to a transmission system and is yet to be registered under
these WEM Rules as a Facility or a Facility that is undergoing an
upgrade that may impact its Facility Class, these terms are to be used
as they will ultimately apply to the relevant Facility.

The measurement location for each of the following terms, where they are
used in this Appendix, is as specified in the relevant clause or, where
applicable, by the relevant Network Operator in consultation with AEMO
and recorded in the relevant Generator Performance Standard:

\(a\) Rated Maximum Active Power;

\(b\) Rated Maximum Apparent Power;

\(c\) Maximum Continuous Current;

\(d\) Rated Minimum Active Power;

\(e\) Temperature Dependency Data; and

\(f\) Generator Performance Chart.

When producing electric power, Electricity Storage which is part of a
Generating System will be considered as Generation and must meet the
Technical Requirements of Appendix 12.

Where the term 'Technical Rules' is used in this Appendix then the
reference to the Technical Rules is to the Technical Rules of Western
Power for the SWIS.

Where terms defined in Technical Rules are used in this Appendix, then
any references to 'power system' in those definitions should be read as
the SWIS.

For ease of reference, a list of the Technical Requirements that apply
to Transmission Connected Generating Systems contained in this Appendix
is set out below.

sufficient to ensure that:

\(a\) power system oscillations, for the frequencies of oscillation of
the Generating System against any other Generating System or device, are
Adequately Damped;

\(b\) operation of the Generating System does not degrade the damping of
any critical mode of oscillation of the power system; and

A12.4.2.3. Control Systems on Generating Systems that control voltage
and Reactive Power must include permanently installed and operational,
monitoring and recording equipment for key variables including each

Operator as part of the Generator Performance Standard.

A12.4.2.5. A Generating System must have a voltage Control System that:

performance and stability in the Technical Rules from being achieved;

\(c\) allows the voltage to be continuously controllable in the range of
at least 95% to 105% of the target voltage (as determined by the Network
Operator), without reliance on a Tap-Changing Transformer and subject to
the Generator Performance Standards for Reactive Power Capability with
the voltage control location agreed with AEMO and the Network Operator;
and

\(d\) has limiting devices to ensure that a voltage disturbance does not
cause a Generating Unit to trip at the limits of its operating
capability. The Generating System must be capable of continuous stable

detract from the performance of any stabilising circuits and must have
settings applied which are coordinated with all Protection Systems.

A12.4.2.6. Where installed, a power system stabiliser must have:

\(a\) two washout filters for each input, with ability to bypass one of
them if necessary;

\(b\) sufficient (and not less than two) lead-lag transfer function
blocks (or equivalent number of complex poles and zeros) with adjustable

the Generating Unit;

\(c\) monitoring and recording equipment for key variables including
inputs, output and the inputs to the lead-lag transfer function blocks;
and

isolation from the power system by injection of test signals, sufficient
to establish the transfer function of the power system stabiliser.

Factor equivalent to 2% of the Rated Maximum Apparent Power of the
Generating System from the Target Setpoint; and

\(b\) allow the Reactive Power or Power Factor Target Setpoint to be
continuously controllable across the Reactive Power Capability range
specified in the relevant Generator Performance Standard.

limiters, must be approved by the Network Operator and AEMO as part of
the Generator Performance Standard.

the excitation required to achieve generation at the rated output, rated
speed and nominal voltage in accordance with the relevant Australian
Standard or ISO Standard for Synchronous Generating Units. The details
regarding which relevant Australian Standard or ISO Standard applies is
documented in the guidelines published by the Network Operator under
clause 3A.4.4;
