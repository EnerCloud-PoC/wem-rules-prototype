6.3B.2. AEMO must use the following process to adjust a Standing STEM
Submission to make a valid STEM Submission for a Trading Interval under
clause 6.3B.1B and to review and adjust a STEM Submission for a Trading
Interval under clause 6.3B.1C:

\(a\) If the cumulative MWh quantity over all Price-Quantity Pairs in
the Portfolio Supply Curve is greater than the Maximum Supply Capability
for the Market Participant for the Trading Interval which was determined
on the current Scheduling Day under clause 6.3A.3(e), the Price-Quantity
Pairs must be adjusted downward so that the cumulative MWh quantity over
all the Price‑Quantity Pairs equals the Maximum Supply Capability. This
must be achieved by deleting successively or reducing the highest price
Price‑Quantity Pairs until the cumulative MWh quantity over all
remaining Price‑Quantity Pairs equals the Maximum Supply Capability.

\(b\) If the cumulative MWh quantity over all Price-Quantity Pairs in
the Portfolio Demand Curve is greater than the Maximum Consumption
Capability for the Market Participant for the Trading Interval which was
determined on the current Scheduling Day under clause 6.3A.3(f), the
Price-Quantity Pairs must be adjusted downward so that the cumulative
MWh quantity over all the Price‑Quantity Pairs equals the Maximum
Consumption Capability. This must be achieved by deleting successively
or reducing the highest price Price‑Quantity Pairs until the cumulative
MWh quantity over all remaining Price‑Quantity Pairs equals the Maximum
Consumption Capability.

\(c\) If the price in any Price-Quantity Pair in the Portfolio Supply
Curve or Portfolio Demand Curve is greater than the Energy Offer Price
Ceiling which will apply (or which AEMO expects will apply) in the
Trading Interval, the price in the Price-Quantity Pair must be replaced
by the Energy Offer Price Ceiling which will apply (or which AEMO
expects will apply) in the Trading Interval.

\(d\) If the price in any Price-Quantity Pair in the Portfolio Supply
Curve or Portfolio Demand Curve is less than the Energy Offer Price
Floor which will apply (or which AEMO expects will apply) in the Trading
Interval, the price in the Price-Quantity Pair must be replaced by the
Energy Offer Price Floor which will apply (or which AEMO expects will
apply) in the Trading Interval.

\(e\) \[Blank\]

\(f\) If multiple Price-Quantity Pairs in the Portfolio Supply Curve
share the same price, they must be replaced with a single Price-Quantity
Pair for that price with a MWh quantity equal to the sum of the MWh
quantities in the Price-Quantity Pairs which are being replaced.

\(g\) If multiple Price-Quantity Pairs in the Portfolio Demand Curve
share the same price, they must be replaced with a single Price-Quantity
Pair for that price with a MWh quantity equal to the sum of the MWh
quantities in the Price-Quantity Pairs which are being replaced.

To avoid doubt, the process steps specified in this clause 6.3B.2 must
be performed in the order listed, and a reference to a Portfolio Supply
Curve or Portfolio Demand Curve in those clauses is a reference to the
Portfolio Supply Curve or Portfolio Demand Curve as adjusted by any
earlier steps in the process.

6.3B.3. Where AEMO receives STEM Submission data from a Market
Participant under clause 6.3B.1, AEMO must, as soon as practicable after
receiving the STEM submission data:

\(a\) if the STEM Submission data complies with section 6.6, make the
STEM Submission data the STEM Submission for that Trading Day; and

\(b\) notify the Market Participant which submitted the STEM Submission
data under clause 6.3B.1, that:

i\. the STEM Submission data has been made the STEM Submission for that
Trading Day; or

ii\. AEMO has rejected the STEM Submission data as it did not comply
with section 6.6.

<th><p><strong>Explanatory Note</strong></p>
<p>The structure of Chapter 7 reflects the integration of the operation
of the Real-Time Market and the Central Dispatch Process in accordance
with the Security Constrained Economic Dispatch (<strong>SCED</strong>)
market model.</p>
<p>More specifically:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Chapter 7 is renamed ‘Real-Time Market Operation and Dispatch’
and substantially amended; and</p></li>
<li><p>Chapters 7A and 7B are deleted.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>As the name implies, SCED determines the most economic dispatch of
individual resources across the SWIS. In the current market, AEMO
schedules energy and Essential System Services separately, and
congestion on the network is accounted for by amendments to the market
dispatch.</p>
<p>The adoption of the SCED market model, which includes consideration
of network constraints in the calculation of dispatch schedules, is
essential for the SWIS in order to maintain system security as
congestion increases. Adopting the SCED market model will require AEMO
to replace the existing market and dispatch systems that it uses to
operate the Wholesale Electricity Market.</p>
<p>Adopting a SCED market model is fundamental to realising the benefits
of the sustainable and efficient management of network constraints, and
is expected to deliver the following benefits.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>transparent determination of the least-cost dispatch outcome for
the market, accounting for generation offers and network conditions, and
allowing Market Participants to respond, resulting in increased
competition in the Real-Time Market and a downward pressure on the
energy price over time;</p></li>
<li><p>greater automation in the calculation of network constraints,
which improves network efficiency by allowing constraints to be set less
conservatively without compromising system reliability; and</p></li>
<li><p>greater automation in the dispatch process, so that system
security can be managed efficiently as the level of constraints
increases, and the generation mix continues to change.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>However, various clauses in Chapter 7 are also amended by the October
2021 RCM Pricing Amendments, including as a result of tranche based
dispatch payments for DSPs ceasing from the 2019 Reserve Capacity Cycle
(i.e. from the 2021 Capacity Year), the Tranche 1 Amendments, the
Miscellaneous Amendments No. 1 and the Amending Rules contained in the
Rule Change Panel's Final Report for Rule Change Proposal RC_2014_03

<p>Several clauses in Chapter 7 of the current WEM Rules have also been
amended by the Tranche 5 Amendments (Schedule B). However, as this
Chapter 7 reflects the amendments that will apply from the start of the
new market, please refer to the Tranche 5 Amendments to see the
amendments to those clauses that will apply until that time.</p>
<p>The key changes proposed to the Real-Time Market arrangements in
Chapter 7 pursuant to the Tranche 6 Amendments include:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>changes to the rules around the provision and use of Injection

<li><p>clauses 7.4.54 to 7.4.62 – Standing Submissions.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>An overview of the main changes affecting section 7.4 is provided
below.</p>
<p><strong>Changes to Real-Time Market Submission terminology and
processing rules</strong></p>
<p>Section 7.4 has been amended to clarify the definitions of “Real-Time
Market Submission” and “Standing Real-Time Market Submission” and the
general processing rules for these submissions. Under the proposed
changes:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>A Real-Time Market Submission relates to a Registered Facility,
Market Service and Dispatch Interval.</p></li>
<li><p>A Market Participant may include multiple Real-Time Market
Submissions in a single electronic submission. AEMO will either accept
the electronic submission (and all the Real-Time Market Submissions
within it) or reject the electronic submission (and all the Real-Time
Market Submissions within it).</p></li>
<li><p>A Standing Real-Time Market Submission is a default Real-Time
Market Submission for a Registered Facility and Market Service for
Dispatch Intervals starting at specified times on Trading Days of a
specified type.</p></li>
<li><p>A Market Participant may include multiple Standing Real-Time
Market Submissions in a single electronic submission, but must ensure
that the Standing Real-Time Market Submissions in an electronic
submission for a Registered Facility and Market Service, in combination,
uniquely specify the default Real-Time Market Submission to apply for
each Dispatch Interval in a generic Trading Week.</p></li>
<li><p>At any point in time, the Real-Time Market Submission for a
Registered Facility, Market Service and Dispatch Interval is the
(variation) Real-Time Market Submission most recently accepted by AEMO
under clause 7.4.49(a)(i), or, if no such submission exists, the most
recently accepted applicable Standing Real-Time Market
Submission.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Changes to the provision and use of Injection and Withdrawal
forecasts for Semi-Scheduled Facilities and Non-Scheduled
Facilities</strong></p>
<p>Previously, a Market Participant was required to ensure that the sum
of the quantities in the Price-Quantity Pairs for Injection in its
Semi-Scheduled Facility Real-Time Market Submission was equal to the
Market Participant’s unconstrained Injection forecast for the Facility.
While this arrangement provided an Injection forecast to AEMO, it could
also restrict the level to which the Facility could be dispatched,
because of the absence of Price-Quantity Pairs covering Injection levels
above the Market Participant’s forecast. Additionally, the arrangement
did not support the provision of Withdrawal forecasts.</p>
<p>Under the proposed new arrangements, the quantities in the
Price-Quantity Pairs for energy for a Semi-Scheduled Facility or
Non-Scheduled Facility should sum to the maximum quantity that the
Market Participant considers the Facility could Inject/Withdraw assuming
it was not constrained by AEMO (including on price), i.e. assuming no
shortage of any intermittent fuel such as wind. The Market Participant
will also include an Unconstrained Injection Forecast and Unconstrained
Withdrawal Forecast, defined as follows, in each Real-Time Market
Submission:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Unconstrained Injection Forecast</strong>: The expected
MW level of Injection at the end of a Dispatch Interval for a
Semi-Scheduled Facility or Non-Scheduled Facility, assuming that the
Facility will not be subject to a Dispatch Instruction or direction from
AEMO that limits its Injection, and allowing for expected conditions,
commitment and control intentions and the effect of any Outages that
have not been rejected for the Facility.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Unconstrained Withdrawal Forecast</strong>: The expected
MW level of Withdrawal at the end of a Dispatch Interval for a
Semi-Scheduled Facility or Non-Scheduled Facility, assuming that the
Facility will not be subject to a Dispatch Instruction or direction from
AEMO that limits its Withdrawal, and allowing for expected conditions,
commitment and control intentions and the effect of any Outages that
have not been rejected for the Facility</p></li>
</ul>
<p>AEMO may use the Unconstrained Injection Forecasts and Unconstrained
Withdrawal Forecasts provided in Real-Time Market Submissions as inputs
to the Dispatch Algorithm, but may also use alternative forecasts if it
reasonably considers they are likely to be more accurate.</p>
<p>Price-Quantity Pairs will continue to be used within the Dispatch
Algorithm to determine Dispatch Caps for Semi-Scheduled Facilities.
However, Semi-Scheduled Facilities will not be constrained where their
Unconstrained Injection Forecasts or Unconstrained Withdrawal Forecasts
are lower than the cleared Price-Quantity Pairs.</p>
<p><strong>Changes to Real-Time Market Submission obligations for
Non-Scheduled Facilities</strong>:</p>
<p>It is important for AEMO to have visibility of a Non-Scheduled
Facility’s intentions to support the production of forward-looking
Market Schedules and provide overall transparency to the market. For
this reason, Market Participants will be required to submit Real-Time
Market Submissions for their Non-Scheduled Facilities.</p>
<p>The submission requirements for Non-Scheduled Facilities have been
separated from the requirements for the Registered Facilities being
actively dispatched by AEMO through the Dispatch Algorithm (Scheduled
Facilities, Semi-Scheduled Facilities and Interruptible Loads). The
Market Participant must declare its intentions (either Injection or
Withdrawal) by including a single Price-Quantity Pair at the price
cap/floor. The Market Participant will also provide an Unconstrained
Injection Forecast and Unconstrained Withdrawal Forecast for each
Dispatch Interval.</p>
<p>These inputs will be used in the Dispatch Algorithm to account for
the expected impact of Non‑Scheduled Facilities, and will be included in
the publication requirements to support transparency.</p>
<p>While Market Participants will be required to make Real-Time Market
Submissions for Non-Scheduled Facilities, they will have a lower
threshold for updating their submissions to reflect that they are not
actively dispatched. The obligation to maintain accurate forecast
quantities for a Non-Scheduled Facility will not attract civil
penalties, and the requirement to update forecast quantities is reduced
to when information supporting underlying expectations has significantly
changed or the Market Participant is knowingly intervening in the
operation of the Facility (e.g. has specific knowledge about Outages,
commitment or control intentions of behind-the-meter components), as
provided for under new clause 7.4.37A.</p>
<p><strong>Relocation of provisions relating to Demand Side Programme
submissions:</strong></p>
<p>The provisions relating to DSP Withdrawal Profile Submissions and
Standing DSP Withdrawal Profile Submissions have been moved from section
7.4 to a new section 7.4A.</p></th>

<p>Amendments to clause 7.4.5 address the following issues:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>When the Pre-Dispatch Schedule projects a shortfall in a
Frequency Control Essential System Service (FCESS), clause 7.4.5(b)
requires SESSM Award holders to update their Real-Time Market
Submissions to offer all the available accredited capacity of their
awarded Facilities as In‑Service Capacity. This could result in more
capacity being offered as In-Service Capacity than is necessary or
desirable.</p></li>
<li><p>The clause does not correctly account for a Facility that is not
subject to any Outage in a Dispatch Interval, e.g. clause 7.4.5(a) would
require the Market Participant to offer the maximum accredited quantity
of the relevant FCESS instead of the contracted quantity in this
situation.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Under the amendments, a Market Participant holding a SESSM Award
must:</p>
<ul>
<li><blockquote>
<p>under normal conditions, offer (at least) the lower of their
contracted quantity and available accredited capacity in the relevant
FCESS, as either Available or In-Service Capacity (clause 7.4.5(a));</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote>
<p>if the Reference Scenario for a Pre-Dispatch Interval projects a
shortfall in the FCESS, ensure that they are offering all their
available accredited capacity in the FCESS, as either Available or
In‑Service Capacity (clause 7.4.5(b)); and</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote>
<p>if the Reference Scenario for a Pre-Dispatch Interval or Dispatch
Interval projects that the relevant Facility will be enabled to provide
the FCESS, ensure that they are offering the relevant Essential System
Service Enablement Quantity as In-Service Capacity, as well as
sufficient In-Service energy capacity to facilitate the FCESS enablement

<p>Feedback from AEMO’s implementation program identified a number of
issues with the proposal to include Demand Side Programmes in the
Dispatch Algorithm, including:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>the potential for inaccurate identification of potential Demand
Side Programme dispatch in the forward Market Schedules;</p></li>
<li><p>issues with the proposed tie-breaking approach; and</p></li>
<li><p>issues relating to the need to take into account the specific
restrictions associated with the dispatch of Demand Side Programmes,
e.g. notice periods, hours available for dispatch, maximum hours of
dispatch per year, etc).</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Due to these issues, Demand Side Programmes will not be dispatched
using the Dispatch Algorithm. Instead, an alternative approach has been
developed for the dispatch of these Facilities.</p>
<p>A key component of this approach is the requirement for Market
Participants to provide DSP Withdrawal Profile Submissions that specify
two forecast quantities for each Dispatch Interval:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>a DSP Unconstrained Withdrawal Quantity, which is the Market
Participant’s estimate of the average MW consumption of its Demand Side
Programme in the Dispatch Interval assuming that the Demand Side
Programme is not affected by any Dispatch Instruction or Reserve
Capacity Test; and</p></li>
<li><p>a DSP Constrained Withdrawal Quantity, which the DSP
Unconstrained Withdrawal Quantity adjusted to take into account the
impact of any impending dispatch or Reserve Capacity Tests about which
the Market Participant has been advised.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The two values are expected to be identical for most Dispatch
Intervals.</p>
<p>New section 7.4A sets out the obligations with respect to DSP
Withdrawal Profile Submissions. The clauses below are structured

7.4A. DSP Withdrawal Profile Submissions

7.4A.1. A Market Participant must ensure that it has made a DSP
Withdrawal Profile Submission or Standing DSP Withdrawal Profile
Submission in accordance with this section 7.4A for each Dispatch
Interval in the Week-Ahead Schedule Horizon for each of its Demand Side
Programmes.

7.4A.2. If AEMO has not accepted a DSP Withdrawal Profile Submission for
a Demand Side Programme and Dispatch Interval under clause 7.4A.15(a),
but has accepted an applicable Standing DSP Withdrawal Profile
Submission, then the Standing DSP Withdrawal Profile Submission is
deemed to be the DSP Withdrawal Profile Submission for the Demand Side
Programme and Dispatch Interval.

7.4A.3. A DSP Withdrawal Profile Submission for a Demand Side Programme
and Dispatch Interval that AEMO accepts under clause 7.4A.15(a) replaces
any previously accepted DSP Withdrawal Profile Submission for, and has
effect in relation to, the Demand Side Programme and Dispatch Interval.

7.4A.4. If:

\(a\) AEMO has not yet accepted a DSP Withdrawal Profile Submission for
a Demand Side Programme and Dispatch Interval under clause 7.4A.15(a);
and

\(b\) AEMO accepts a Standing DSP Withdrawal Profile Submission for the
Demand Side Programme that is applicable to the Dispatch Interval,

then the Standing DSP Withdrawal Profile Submission replaces any
previously accepted Standing DSP Withdrawal Profile Submission as the

7.4A.7 or 7.4A.8 apply, the DSP Unconstrained Withdrawal Quantities and
DSP Constrained Withdrawal Quantities in its DSP Withdrawal Profile
Submissions for the Demand Side Programme accurately reflect the Market
Participant’s reasonable expectation of the Withdrawal of the Demand
Side Programme during the applicable Dispatch Intervals under the
required assumptions.

7.4A.9A. For the purposes of updating DSP Withdrawal Profile Submissions
under clauses 7.4A.5, 7.4A.6, 7.4A.7 or 7.4A.8, a Market Participant
must not include a future Dispatch Interval in its updated DSP

AEMO Control of Registered Facilities

7.6.28. AEMO may, where required for a Registered Facility or equipment
to participate in the Central Dispatch Process, or to provide an
Essential System Service, or otherwise by agreement with a Market
Participant, control specified operations of a Registered Facility or
equipment, including:

\(a\) the starting, loading and stopping of one or more of the Market
Participant’s Scheduled Facilities; and

\(b\) limiting the Injection or Withdrawal of one or more of the Market
Participant’s Semi‑Scheduled Facilities.

7.6.29. The operational control of a Registered Facility by AEMO
pursuant to an agreement referred to in clause 7.6.28:

\(a\) does not remove AEMO’s obligation to record Dispatch Instructions
for those Registered Facilities; and

\(b\) does not affect or modify a Market Participant’s rights and
obligations in respect of a Registered Facility under these WEM Rules.
To avoid doubt, notwithstanding AEMO’s operational control, a Market
Participant must comply with the obligations in section 7.10.

7.6.30. Where AEMO maintains operational control over a Registered
Facility, AEMO must operate the Registered Facility in compliance with
Dispatch Instructions recorded for the Registered Facility.

Dispatch Inflexibilities

7.6.31. Where a Market Participant reasonably expects that its
Registered Facility will be unable to comply with a Dispatch Instruction
for the Registered Facility in a future Dispatch Interval, the Market
Participant must immediately:

\(a\) amend its Real-Time Market Submission for the Registered Facility
by specifying:

i\. the Registered Facility is Inflexible in the relevant Dispatch
Interval; and

ii\. a single offer tranche which specifies the fixed level of
Injection, Withdrawal, or Frequency Co-optimised Essential System
Service enablement, at which the Registered Facility must be operated in
the Dispatch Interval;

\(b\) provide AEMO with a reason why the Registered Facility is
Inflexible which must be able to be independently verified; and

\(c\) if required, submit any Outages for the Registered Facility in
accordance with section 3.21.

7.6.32. AEMO must use reasonable endeavours to issue Dispatch
Instructions consistent with:

\(a\) a Real-Time Market Submission that specifies a Registered Facility
as Inflexible; and

\(b\) a Registered Facility’s Dispatch Inflexibility Profile.

7.6.33. AEMO must document in a WEM Procedure the forms of independent

Price Determination

7.11A. Price Determination Principles

7.11A.1. The principles applying to the determination of prices in the
Real-Time Market are:

\(a\) subject to this section 7.11A, a Market Clearing Price at the
Reference Node is determined by AEMO using the Central Dispatch Process
for each Dispatch Interval;

\(b\) a Reference Trading Price is determined by AEMO as the
time-weighted average of the Market Clearing Prices for energy for each
Dispatch Interval in a Trading Interval;

\(c\) Registered Facilities which operate in accordance with a direction
in the Central Dispatch Process are to be taken into account by AEMO,
but AEMO must not use the applicable Real-Time Market Offers or
Real-Time Market Bids for those Registered Facilities in the calculation
of the Market Clearing Price for the relevant Market Service in the
relevant Dispatch Interval;

\(d\) where a Registered Facility is Inflexible, AEMO must take the
Inflexibility of the Registered Facility into account in the Central
Dispatch Process, but must not use the price in the Real-Time Market
Offer or Real-Time Market Bid for that Registered Facility for the
applicable Market Service in the calculation of the Market Clearing
Price for that Market Service in the relevant Dispatch Interval;

\(e\) Loss Factors and Constraint Equations are to be taken into account
by AEMO in the calculation of Market Clearing Prices;

\(f\) where the Injection or Withdrawal of a Registered Facility is
limited above or below the level at which it would otherwise have been
dispatched by AEMO on the basis of its Real-Time Market Offer or
Real-Time Market Bid for energy due to a Constraint Equation included in
the Dispatch Algorithm under clause 7.5.8(a):

i\. the Registered Facility’s Real-Time Market Offer or Real-Time Market
Bid for energy, as applicable, is to be taken into account by AEMO in
the determination of dispatch, but the Real-Time Market Offer or
Real-Time Market Bid, as applicable, is not to be used by AEMO in the
calculation of the Market Clearing Price for energy in the relevant
Dispatch Interval; and

ii\. the Registered Facility’s Real-Time Market Submissions for other
Frequency Co-optimised Essential System Services are to be used by AEMO
in the determination of dispatch and taken into account in determining
the Market Clearing Prices for those Market Services;

\(g\) subject to section 9.9, AEMO must apply the Reference Trading
Price to both sales and purchases of energy in the relevant Trading
Interval;

\(h\) when a Market Clearing Price is determined for a Frequency
Co-optimised Essential System Service, AEMO must apply that price to
purchases of that Frequency Co-optimised Essential System Service in the
relevant Dispatch Interval; and

\(i\) where there is a shortfall in a Frequency Co-optimised Essential
System Service, AEMO must set the Market Clearing Price for that service
to the difference between the Energy Offer Price Ceiling and the Energy
Offer Price Floor.

7.11B. Determination of Market Clearing Prices

7.11B.1. Subject to section 7.11C, where AEMO runs the Dispatch
Algorithm, AEMO must determine a Market Clearing Price for each Market
Service for a Dispatch Interval.

7.11B.1A. If AEMO fails to run the Dispatch Algorithm to determine
Market Clearing Prices for any Dispatch Interval, then the Market
Clearing Prices for that Dispatch Interval are:

\(a\) if the Dispatch Interval has been included in a previous Dispatch
Schedule, the Market Clearing Prices determined for the Dispatch
Interval in the most recent Dispatch Schedule that includes the Dispatch
Interval; or

\(b\) if the Dispatch Interval has not been included in a previous
Dispatch Schedule, the Market Clearing Prices determined for the
Pre-Dispatch Interval containing the Dispatch Interval in the Reference
Scenario for the most recent Pre-Dispatch Schedule that includes the
Dispatch Interval.

7.11B.2. Subject to clauses 7.11B.3, 7.11B.4 and 7.11B.5, the Market
Clearing Price for a Market Service represents the marginal value of
that Market Service at the Reference Node at that time, which is
calculated as the cost of meeting an incremental change in the
requirement for the Market Service at that time in accordance with
clause 7.6.4.

7.11B.3. If, for any Dispatch Interval:

\(a\) the Market Clearing Prices for the Dispatch Interval have not

\(b\) AEMO reasonably determines that the Central Dispatch Process may
determine that there is insufficient capacity to meet all load; and

\(c\) AEMO has issued a manual load shed direction to a Network Operator
under clause 3.4.4,

then AEMO must set the Energy Market Clearing Price for the Dispatch
Interval to equal the Energy Offer Price Ceiling.

7.11B.3A. If, for any Dispatch Interval, the Energy Market Clearing
Price determined using the Dispatch Algorithm is:

\(a\) greater than the Energy Offer Price Ceiling, then AEMO must set
the Energy Market Clearing Price in that Dispatch Interval to equal the
Energy Offer Price Ceiling; and

\(b\) less than the Energy Offer Price Floor, then AEMO must set the
Energy Market Clearing Price in that Dispatch Interval to equal the
Energy Offer Price Floor.

7.11B.3B. If, for any Dispatch Interval, the Market Clearing Price for a
Frequency Co‑optimised Essential System Service determined using the
Dispatch Algorithm is:

\(a\) greater than the applicable FCESS Clearing Price Ceiling, then
AEMO must set the Market Clearing Price for the Frequency Co-optimised
Essential System Service in that Dispatch Interval to equal the
applicable FCESS Clearing Price Ceiling; and

\(b\) less than zero, then AEMO must set the Market Clearing Price for
the Frequency Co-optimised Essential System Service in that Dispatch
Interval to equal zero.

7.11B.4. If, for any Dispatch Interval, AEMO has determined that the
Dispatch Interval is an Affected Dispatch Interval under clause
7.11C.1A, then AEMO must set the Market Clearing Prices for the Dispatch
Interval in accordance with section 7.11C.

7.11B.4A. If, for any Dispatch Interval, AEMO has not determined that
the Dispatch interval is an Affected Dispatch Interval, and AEMO has
declared the Dispatch Interval to be an Intervention Dispatch Interval
under clause 7.11C.6, then AEMO must set the Market Clearing Prices for
the Dispatch Interval in accordance with clauses 7.11C.7, 7.11C.8,
7.11C.9 and 7.11C.10.

7.11B.5. If, for any Dispatch Interval, the Market Clearing Price for a

7.11C. Corrections to Price Determinations and Intervention Pricing

7.11C.1. AEMO must develop procedures for the automatic identification

an Affected Dispatch Interval.

7.11C.1A. AEMO must use the procedures developed under clause 7.11C.1 to
determine whether each Dispatch Interval is an Affected Dispatch
Interval.

7.11C.2. Where AEMO determines that a Dispatch Interval is an Affected
Dispatch Interval, and no more than 30 minutes have passed since the
publication of the Market Clearing Prices for the Affected Dispatch
Interval, AEMO must:

\(a\) replace all Market Clearing Prices with the corresponding prices
for the Last Correct Dispatch Interval; and

\(b\) if AEMO has already calculated the relevant Reference Trading
Price, recalculate and adjust the Reference Trading Price, in accordance
with clause 7.11A.1(b).

7.11C.3. As soon as reasonably practicable after the action referred in
clause 7.11C.2, AEMO must publish on the WEM Website a report outlining:

\(a\) the reasons for determining that a Dispatch Interval was an
Affected Dispatch Interval;

\(b\) whether that determination was correct; and

\(c\) what action will be taken to minimise the risk of a similar event
in future.

7.11C.4. At least once each year, AEMO must review the effectiveness of
the automated processes developed by AEMO under clause 7.11C.1 and
publish a report on the WEM Website detailing the findings of the
review.

7.11C.5. A report under clause 7.11C.4 must:

\(a\) cover the 12-month period since the end of the period covered by
the last report;

\(b\) be published within 3 months of the end of the review period
covered by the report; and

\(c\) include the following:

i\. details of all Affected Dispatch Intervals which should not have
been identified as Affected Dispatch Intervals;

ii\. the reasons why the Affected Dispatch Intervals identified under
clause 7.11C.5(c)(i) were identified as Affected Dispatch Intervals; and

iii\. details of any Dispatch Intervals that AEMO has subsequently
determined should have been identified by AEMO as Affected Dispatch
Intervals, but were not.

7.11C.5A.AEMO must develop and submit a Procedure Change Proposal where
it considers that a change is required to the WEM Procedure developed
under clause 7.11C.1 as a result of a report that it has published under
clause 7.11C.4.

reasonable opinion, the reason for an AEMO Intervention Event is to
obtain either:

\(a\) a Market Service for which a Market Clearing Price is determined
by the Dispatch Algorithm; or

\(b\) a service that is a direct substitute for a Market Service for
which a Market Clearing Price is determined by the Dispatch Algorithm,

then AEMO must, in accordance with the methodology or assumptions to be
documented in the WEM Procedure referred to in clause 7.11C.11, set the

\(c\) a service for which a Market Clearing Price is not determined by
the Dispatch Algorithm, regardless of whether energy or Frequency
Co-optimised Essential System Services are also provided incidental to
the provision of the service,

then AEMO must continue to set the Market Clearing Prices for the
Intervention Dispatch Interval in accordance with section 7.11B,
excluding 7.11B.4A.

7.11C.9. If more than one AEMO Intervention Event is in effect in
respect of an Intervention Dispatch Interval, AEMO must set the Market
Clearing Prices pursuant to clause 7.11C.7 as if:

\(a\) the services described in clause 7.11C.7 were not provided; and

\(b\) energy or any Essential System Services provided incidental to the
provision of any services described in clause 7.11C.8 were taken into
account.

7.11C.10. AEMO must use its reasonable endeavours to set Market Clearing
Prices according to clause 7.11C.7 as soon as practicable following an
AEMO Intervention Event, but may continue to set Market Clearing Prices
as if no AEMO Intervention Event had occurred for Dispatch Intervals
before the later of:

\(a\) if AEMO is able to operate the SWIS in accordance with the Power
System Security Principles, the Dispatch Interval immediately following
the first Intervention Dispatch Interval; or

\(b\) if AEMO is not able to operate the SWIS in accordance with the
Power System Security Principles, the second Dispatch Interval after
AEMO became able to operate the SWIS in accordance with the Power System
Security Principles after the first Intervention Dispatch Interval.

7.11C.11. AEMO must document in a WEM Procedure the methodology it will
use, and any assumptions it may be required to make, to determine the
Market Clearing Prices under clauses 7.11C.7, 7.11C.8 and 7.11C.10. The
methodology must, wherever reasonably practicable:

\(a\) be consistent with the principles for the determination of Market
Clearing Prices set out in section 7.11A; and

\(b\) enable AEMO to determine and publish such prices in accordance
with the applicable timeframes for the publication of the Market
Clearing Prices under these WEM Rules.

7.11D. Real-Time Market Suspension

7.11D.1. AEMO may suspend the Real-Time Market:

\(a\) in the event of a system shutdown or major supply disruption;

\(b\) when AEMO has been requested by the Minister, under clause 2.44.1,
to suspend the market or operate all or part of the power system in
connection with the exercise of emergency powers; or

\(c\) when AEMO determines that it is necessary because it has become
impossible to maintain Power System Security in accordance with the
provisions of these WEM Rules due to:

i\. failure of its IT systems;

ii\. loss of communications or control systems required to maintain
Power System Security; or

iii\. any other reason as identified in the WEM Procedure published
under clause 7.11D.4.

7.11D.2. Where AEMO deems, in its reasonable opinion, it is practicable
to resume the Central Dispatch Process it must:

\(a\) lift any suspension of the Real-Time Market at commencement of the
next practicable Trading Interval, in accordance with the process
described in the WEM Procedure referred to in clause 7.11D.4; and

\(b\) resume the determination of Market Clearing Prices.

7.11D.3. AEMO must issue a Market Advisory when suspending or lifting
the suspension of the Real-Time Market.

7.11D.4. AEMO must document in a WEM Procedure:

\(a\) the process by which AEMO will determine to suspend the Real-Time
Market;

\(b\) the reasons AEMO may suspend the Real-Time Market;

\(c\) the processes which Market Participants are required to follow
during the suspension; and

\(d\) the processes AEMO will follow during the suspension including the
process to lift the suspension which must provide a notice period of not
less than two hours.

7.11E. Administered Pricing in the Event of Market System Failure

7.11E.1. If the Real-Time Market is suspended under clause 7.11D.1(a),
AEMO must set the final Market Clearing Prices for each Market Service
in any Dispatch Interval during the suspension as follows:

\(a\) the Final Energy Market Clearing Price is to equal the Energy
Offer Price Ceiling;

\(b\) the Final Regulation Raise Market Clearing Price is to equal zero
and the Essential System Service Enablement Quantity for each Registered
Facility accredited for Regulation Raise for the Dispatch Interval is
zero;

\(c\) the Final Regulation Lower Market Clearing Price is to equal zero
and the Essential System Service Enablement Quantity for each Registered
Facility accredited for Regulation Lower for the Dispatch Interval is
zero;

\(d\) the Final Contingency Reserve Raise Market Clearing Price is to
equal zero and the Essential System Service Enablement Quantity for each
Registered Facility accredited for Contingency Reserve Raise for the
Dispatch Interval is zero;

\(e\) the Final Contingency Reserve Lower Market Clearing Price is to
equal zero and the Essential System Service Enablement Quantity for each
Registered Facility accredited for Contingency Reserve Lower for the
Dispatch Interval is zero; and

\(f\) the Final RoCoF Control Service Market Clearing Price is to equal
zero and the RoCoF Control Service requirements for the Dispatch
Interval is zero.

7.11E.2. If the Real-Time Market is suspended under clause 7.11D.1(b),
AEMO must set the final Market Clearing Prices for each Market Service
in any Dispatch Interval during the suspension as requested by the
Minister.

7.11E.3. If the Real-Time Market is suspended under clause 7.11D.1(c),
AEMO must set the final Market Clearing Prices for each Market Service
in any Dispatch Interval during the suspension as the average final
Market Clearing Price for that Market Service in the equivalent
intervals in the four most recent completed Trading Weeks.

7.11E.4. Where, for the purposes of clause 7.11E.3, a Market Clearing
Price is not available for a Market Service for an equivalent Dispatch
Interval in the four most recent completed Trading Weeks referred to in
clause 7.11E.3, AEMO must set the final Market Clearing Prices for each
Market Service as follows:

\(a\) where there is no Final Energy Market Clearing Price available for
the equivalent Dispatch Interval, AEMO must set the Final Energy Market
Clearing Price as the average price for energy from the most recently
published price for energy for 28 consecutive Trading Days for the
equivalent Dispatch Interval;

\(b\) where there is no Final Regulation Raise Market Clearing Price
available for the equivalent Dispatch Interval, AEMO must set the Final
Regulation Raise Market Clearing Price as the average price for
Regulation Raise, or equivalent service, from the most recently
published price for the service for 28 consecutive Trading Days for the
equivalent Dispatch Interval;

\(c\) where there is no Final Regulation Lower Market Clearing Price
available for the equivalent Dispatch Interval, AEMO must set the Final
Regulation Lower Market Clearing Price as the average price for
Regulation Lower, or equivalent service, from the most recently
published price for the service for 28 consecutive Trading Days for the
equivalent Dispatch Interval;

\(d\) where there is no Final Contingency Reserve Raise Market Clearing
Price available for the equivalent Dispatch Interval, AEMO must set the
Final Contingency Reserve Raise Market Clearing Price as:

Margin(di) × Energy\_Price(di)

where:

i\. Margin is the Spinning Reserve margin price as the most recent
determination by the Economic Regulation Authority for the equivalent
Dispatch Interval; and

ii\. Energy\_Price is the average price for energy from the most
recently published energy prices for 28 consecutive Trading Days for the
equivalent Dispatch Interval;

\(e\) where there is no Final Contingency Reserve Lower Market Clearing
Price available for the equivalent Dispatch Interval, AEMO must set the
Final Contingency Reserve Lower Price Market Clearing Price using an
estimation method that takes into account the quantum and price set by
the Economic Regulation Authority for load rejection reserve; and

\(f\) where there is no Final RoCoF Control Service Market Clearing
Price available for the equivalent Dispatch Interval, AEMO must set the
RoCoF Control Service requirements for the Dispatch Interval to zero and
set the Final RoCoF Control Service Market Clearing Price to zero.

7.11E.5. All administered prices set under clauses 7.11E.3 and 7.11E.4
will be subject to a floor of $0.

7.11E.6. To avoid doubt, and without limiting clause 1.55.9, for the
purposes of the time periods specified in clauses 7.11E.3 and 7.11E.4,
AEMO may, to the extent it considers necessary to set the final Market
Clearing Prices specified in those clauses, use any data and information
under the Pre-Amended Rules (as defined in clause 1.55.9) that it
considers reasonable to use in the circumstances.

<p>Section 7.13A enables AEMO to determine the Not-In-Service Capacity

required to present the Facility's capacity at least up to its Reserve
Capacity Obligation Quantity in their market submissions as ‘available’

7.13A.1. AEMO must determine the Not In-Service Capacity for each
Scheduled Facility or Semi-Scheduled Facility f for which a Market
Participant holds Capacity Credits, in the Dispatch Interval DI as
either:

\(a\) where AEMO has directed a Registered Facility to offer its
capacity as In Service:

> NISCap(f,DI) = Max(0, Min(RCOQ(f,DI), ReqDispEnergy(f,DI)) –
> Max(ISSDCEnergy(f,DI), ISDispEnergy(f,DI))

\(b\) otherwise:

> NISCap(f,DI) = Max(0, Min(RCOQ(f,DI), EstDispEnergy(f,DI)) –
> Max(ISSDCEnergy(f,DI), ISDispEnergy(f,DI))

where:

i\. NISCap(f,DI) is the Not In-Service Capacity quantity for the
relevant Facility f in Dispatch Interval DI;

ii\. EstDispEnergy(f,DI) is the quantity of estimated energy dispatch
immediately prior to the Start Decision Cutoff time for the relevant
Facility f in Dispatch Interval DI, calculated in accordance with clause
7.13A.2;

iii\. ISSDCEnergy(f,DI) is the quantity of In-Service Capacity offered
immediately after the Start Decision Cutoff time for the relevant
Facility f in Dispatch Interval DI, calculated in accordance with clause
7.13A.3;

iv\. ISDispEnergy(f,DI) is the total MW quantity of In-Service Capacity

Congestion Rental

7.14. Calculation of Congestion Rental

7.14.1. AEMO must calculate for each Registered Facility and each
Dispatch Interval of a Trading Day, the Congestion Rental in respect of
the full set of Network Constraints. The Congestion Rental for
Registered Facility f in Dispatch Interval DI is:

$CongestionRental\left( \text{f,DI} \right)\text{=}\text{\\}\sum\_{\text{n}\text{∈}\text{N}}^{}{\text{Conge}\text{s}\text{tionCoefficient}\left( \text{f,n,DI} \right)\text{\\}\text{×}\text{\\}\text{Mar}\text{g}\text{inalConstraintValue(n,DI)}}$

Where:

\(a\) ConstraintCoefficient(f,n,DI) is the coefficient of Registered
Facility f in respect of the cleared energy quantity of Registered
Facility f in Network Constraint n in Dispatch Interval DI;

\(b\) MarginalConstraintValue(n,DI) is the marginal value of Network
Constraint n in Dispatch Interval DI; and

\(c\) n∈N denotes all Network Constraints applied in
Dispatch Interval DI.
