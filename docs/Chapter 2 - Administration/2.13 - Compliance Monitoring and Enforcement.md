??? info "Explanatory Notes"

    Clause 2.13.2 is a new clause that contains ERA's obligation to investigate behaviour which results in the market not functioning effectively.

1.	monitor Rule Participant’s behaviour for compliance with section 7.10;

2.	monitor Rule Participant’s behaviour for compliance with the WEM Procedure referred to in clause 2.29.9A;

3.	ensure it has processes and systems in place to allow it to monitor Rule Participant's behaviour in accordance with clause 2.13.7(a) and clause 2.13.7
(b), including developing systems for monitoring;

4.	support the Economic Regulation Authority's monitoring of Rule Participants’ behaviour, including having processes and systems to provide the Economic Regulation Authority with data, information, documents or analysis under clauses 2.13.4, 2.13.7, 2.13.8(a), 2.13.8(b) or 2.13.14, as applicable; and

    The clause will be reviewed further to insert specific WEM Rule provisions and WEM Procedures that AEMO must actively monitor. Consultation on clause 2.13.7 will be conducted in a subsequent tranche of draft Amending Rules.

### 2.13.8.	:material-history:{ title="View version history" } :material-note-plus:{ title="Add note to rule" } :material-format-color-highlight:{ title="Highlight rule" } 
Where the Economic Regulation Authority has reason to believe AEMO may be able to assist it to monitor Rule Participants’ behaviour (including each Network Operator’s behaviour) for compliance with the WEM Rules and WEM Procedures, it may request AEMO to:

1.	undertake analysis of any market related data, information and document produced or exchanged under clause 2.13.4; or

2.	provide any specific market related data, information and document produced or exchanged in accordance with the WEM Rules or WEM p rocedures in AEMO’s possession or control not provided by AEMO to the Economic Regulation Authority under clause 2.13.4, to assist to monitor a Rule Participant's compliance with a specific obligation or requirement.

### 2.13.13. :material-history:{ title="View version history" } :material-note-plus:{ title="Add note to rule" } :material-format-color-highlight:{ title="Highlight rule" }

??? info "Explanatory Notes"

    Clause 2.13.13(a) ensures that even where AEMO is not required to report an alleged breach under clause 2.13.12, AEMO is not relieved of its obligation to monitor Rule Participants’ compliance with the WEM Rules and WEM Procedures specified in clause 2.13.7.

??? info "Explanatory Notes"

    Clause 2.13.14 is a new clause that sets out when AEMO is not required to notify the ERA of breaches.

### 2.13.15. :material-history:{ title="View version history" } :material-note-plus:{ title="Add note to rule" } :material-format-color-highlight:{ title="Highlight rule" } 
Except where clause 2.13.14 applies, where AEMO becomes aware of an alleged breach of the WEM Rules (other than a provision of the WEM Rules referred to in clause 2.13.7) or the WEM Procedures developed by AEMO then it must notify the Economic Regulation Authority in accordance with the WEM Procedure referred to in [clause 2.15.4](https://enercloud-poc.github.io/wem-rules-prototype/Chapter%202%20-%20Administration/2.15%20-%20Monitoring%20and%20Reporting%20WEM%20Procedures/#2151).

??? info "Explanatory Notes"

    Clause 2.13.15 is equivalent to existing clause 2.13.9C and is amended to refer to AEMO’s requirement to report alleged breaches to the ERA being subject to clause 2.13.14, which does not require AEMO to report alleged breaches that the ERA should already be aware of. This is to avoid unnecessary duplication of notifications to the ERA. AEMO will be required to outline in the WEM Procedure the situations where ERA would already be aware of an alleged breach and therefore notification by AEMO will not be required. The clause also incorporates the changes in relation to Generator Performance Standards which will follow 3A processes.
    Please note that even though the ERA may have notice of the alleged breach though data collection or other means, AEMO is still required to notify the ERA of all alleged breaches that relate to power system security and reliability.
