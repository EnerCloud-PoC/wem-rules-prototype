<p>Clause <abbr title="The Economic Regulation Authority must investigate any market behaviour of a Rule Participant if it considers that the behaviour has resulted in the market not functioning effectively.">2.13.2</abbr> is a new clause that contains ERA's obligation to investigate behaviour which results in the market not functioning effectively.

<p>Clause <abbr title="The Economic Regulation Authority must investigate any market behaviour of a Rule Participant if it considers that the behaviour has resulted in the market not functioning effectively.">2.13.2</abbr> will be further reviewed to account for the decisions made in Energy Sector Governance: Proposed Changes to the Regulatory Framework which are proposed to commence on 1 July 2021.</p>
