<p><strong>Network Access Quantity</strong></p>
<p>AEMO is required to determine an initial Network Access Quantity for
each Facility (other than a GIA Facility) that was assigned Capacity
Credits for the 2021 Reserve Capacity Cycle.</p>
<p>The initial Network Access Quantity for a Facility will be the lower
of:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>the Capacity Credits held for the Facility for the 2021 Reserve
Capacity Cycle; and</p></li>
<li><p>the Certified Reserve Capacity that AEMO has assigned to the
Facility for the 2022 Reserve Capacity Cycle.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The purpose of the initial Network Access Quantity is to give
existing holders of Capacity Credits priority over new entrants (which
includes any upgrades to existing Facilities) for the purposes of
determining Network Access Quantities for Facilities for the 2022
Reserve Capacity Cycle.</p>
<p>The initial Network Access Quantity determined for a Facility does
not set the Network Access Quantity to be determined for the Facility in
any subsequent Reserve Capacity Cycle.</p>
<p><strong>CC Uplift Quantity</strong></p>
<p>The WEM Rules include a supplementary mechanism to ‘uplift’ the
allocation assigned to a Facility in the 2021 Reserve Capacity Cycle.
The ‘Capacity Credit Uplift’ only applies to non GIA Facilities.  The
uplift represents the difference between an initial NAQ value determined
for a Facility (in accordance with Step 3(a) of Appendix 3) and the
Capacity Credits assigned to the Facility in the 2021 Reserve Capacity
Cycle, but is only provided up to the amount of Certified Reserve
Capacity assigned to the Facility in the Reserve Capacity Cycle that NAQ
is first assigned.</p>
<p>Capacity Credit Uplift Quantities are treated the same as Capacity
Credits for the purpose of the WEM Rules except that they will not be
taken into account when AEMO determines whether the Reserve Capacity
Requirement has been met.</p>
<p>The sum of a Facility’s NAQ and its Capacity Credit Uplift must not
exceed the Facility’s Certified Reserve Capacity.  If the sum of the NAQ
and the Capacity Credit Uplift exceeds the Certified Reserve Capacity
for the Facility, then the amount of the Capacity Credit Uplift will be
reduced.</p></th>

<p>Clauses 4.10.1(bA)(iii) and 4.10.1(bA)(iv) are amended and deleted,
respectively, to reflect the deletion of the current regime for

<p>Clause 4.10.1(f) is amended to:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>delete the reference to three separate blocks of Reserve Capacity

July 2021 and apply until the Miscellaneous Amendments No. 1 (Schedule

<p>Clause 4.10.1 is modified to clarify that Facilities are likely to
contain loads as well as energy producing systems, and to remove the
undefined term 'embedded load' and use defined terms.</p>
<p>Tranche 6 Exposure Draft 1 included amendments to clause 4.10.1
to:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>clarify which requirements under clause 4.10.1(e) relate to a
Non-Intermittent Generating System rather than its parent
Facility;</p></li>
<li><p>remove unnecessary repetition by combining clauses 4.10.1(fA),

<li><p>extend clause 4.10.1(fD)(ii) to require the provision of maximum
Charge Level capabilities and temperature dependence information for
Non-Scheduled Facilities that comprise only Electric Storage Resources;

<li><p>clarify that the test in clause 4.10.1(k) should only use

</ul>
<p>Tranche 6 Exposure Draft 2 included an amendment to clause 4.10.1(f)

Rate Limits are no longer required under the proposed changes to Demand

<p>Market Participants who fund the cost of augmenting the shared
network will be assigned a Network Access Quantity in priority to other
new entrants.</p>
<p>New replacement section 4.10A sets out the process for a Facility to
be classified as a Network Augmentation Funding Facility and the
priority such Facilities will be afforded for the purpose of AEMO
determining Network Access Quantities for Facilities in accordance with
section 4.15.</p>
<p>The process includes:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>the Market Participant must nominate to be classified as a
Network Augmentation Funding Facility in the Expression of Interest for
the Reserve Capacity Cycle for which it is seeking certification of
Reserve Capacity for the Facility;</p></li>
<li><p>the Market Participant must provide evidence of its commitment to
fund the augmentation and that the augmentation will be completed and
in-service before the start of the Capacity Year to which the
application for certified Reserve Capacity relates;</p></li>
<li><p>the funding must increase the capacity of the shared network and
not solely comprise the Market Participant’s contribution for connection
assets;</p></li>
<li><p>AEMO will validate the information provided by the Market
Participant with the relevant Network Operator and determine whether the
Facility will be classified as a Network Augmentation Funding
Facility;</p></li>
<li><p>where the Facility is classified as a Network Augmentation
Funding Facility, it will take priority over certain other new entrants
for the purposes of AEMO assignment Network Access Quantities to
Facilities; and</p></li>
<li><p>AEMO will develop or update Constraint Equations based on Limit
Advice provided by the relevant Network Operator in respect of the
augmentation for use in the Network Access Quantity Model.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>A Network Augmentation Funding Facility will only be assigned an NAQ
taking into account the additional network capacity as a result of the
augmentation works paid by the Market Participant in respect the
Facility if the NAQ does not negatively impact on the NAQ determined for
Facilities higher up in the priority order as set out in Appendix

the Rule Change Panel's Final Report for Rule Change Proposal RC_2014_03
(Administrative Improvements to the Outage Process). Further amendments
may be made to reflect the intent that clause 4.11.1(h) refers to the
WEM Procedure in clause 3.21.17 until clause 4.9.10 commences on 1
November 2021.</p>
<p>Clause 4.11.1(j) is amended to make it clear that the Certified
Reserve Capacity for a DSP must only be in respect of Associated Loads
at the same TNI.</p>
<p>Clause 4.11.1 is also modified to remove the undefined term 'embedded
load', and reference defined terms.</p></th>

<p>The amendments to clause 4.12.1(a) simplify the drafting and ensure
that it is consistent with the Net STEM Shortfall calculations specified
in clauses 4.26.2AA to 4.26.2AH.</p>
<p>The amended clause requires a Market Participant to provide for each
Trading Interval a quantity of capacity through the Bilateral Submission
and STEM Submission processes that is greater than or equal to the
‘required’ quantity for that Market Participant and Trading
Interval.</p>
<p>The quantity of capacity deemed to have been provided is determined
using the CAPASTEM(p,t) calculation in clause 4.26.2AE, which
incorporates:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>the Market Participant’s Net Contract Position;</p></li>
<li><p>STEM Offers that were not scheduled in the STEM Auction;
and</p></li>
<li><p>STEM Bids that were scheduled in the STEM Auction.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The required quantity is determined using the STEMREQ(p,t)
calculation in clause 4.26.2AB. STEMREQ(p,t) is based on the STEM
Reserve Capacity Obligation Quantities of the Market Participant’s
Scheduled Facilities and Semi-Scheduled Facilities, with an adjustment
to account for capacity that was available in real time but was expected
by AEMO to be subject to a Forced Outage when AEMO estimated Capacity
Adjusted Forced Outage Quantities for the Trading Day on the relevant
Scheduling Day.</p>
<p>Note that clause 4.12.1 as set out in the Tranche 5 Amendments
(Schedule I, paragraph 27.1) supersedes the amendments to clauses
### 4.12.1(a)-(c) as set out in the Tranches 2 and 3 Amendments (Schedule C,
paragraph 87.1). However, the Tranche 5 Amendments contains an error in
that the instruction deletes clause 4.12.1 but only replaces it with
subclauses (a) and (b) and not also with the opening paragraph.</p>
<p>To achieve the intended outcome, the Tranches 2 and 3 Amendments and
Tranche 5 Amendments to clause 4.12.1 will not be commenced. Instead the
Tranche 6 Amendments will replace the existing clause 4.12.1.</p></th>

<th><p><strong>Explanatory Note</strong></p>
<p>Section 4.15 sets out the new Network Access Quantity
(<strong>NAQ</strong>) framework.</p>
<p>The NAQ:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>defines the network capacity, in MW, available to a Facility for
the purpose of determining the Capacity Credits that can be assigned to
the Facility up to the amount of its Certified Reserve Capacity;
and</p></li>
<li><p>establishes a preferential right to receive a Capacity Credit,
which can only be reduced in specific circumstances.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The primary purpose of the NAQ is to protect a Facility’s quantity of
Capacity Credits from an unhedgeable risk of being inefficiently
displaced by new entrant facilities connecting in constrained sections
of the network, where that additional capacity is not needed for system
reliability but is simply displacing an existing performing
resource.</p>
<p>The NAQ protects the investment in Facilities that continue to
participate in the RCM and meet all their performance obligations. A
Facility that, for reasons related to its own poor performance, fails to
provide its capacity to the RCM when required by the system surrenders
its ability to retain the unreliable portion of its NAQ. A Facility that
retires (or is mothballed or removed from service) must relinquish its
NAQ.</p>
<p>The NAQ is determined in relation to network capacity and is based on
the physical limits of the network. Hence, the NAQ serves as a cap on
the amount of Capacity Credits that can be assigned in specific regions
of the network. NAQ will be determined for a Facility up to the amount
of network capacity that can accommodate the Facility’s Certified
Reserve Capacity at peak times or other periods of low reserve. This
will ensure that the sum of NAQ determined for Facilities in specific
network regions (and in aggregate for the network as a whole) does not
exceed the transfer capability of the network.</p>
<p>Once NAQ is determined, new Facilities seeking to connect in a
specific region of the network can only receive NAQ up to the residual
capacity of the network in that region, after accounting for NAQ that
has already been determined.</p>
<p>A Facility’s NAQ can be reduced or increased due to ‘organic’ changes
that are beyond the control of the Facility i.e. due to changes in
demand, network configuration, or weather conditions for intermittent
facilities. The policy position is to afford these facilities a priority
for additional NAQ should conditions improve (ahead of other capacity).
This is intended to be implemented in the new framework by tracking a
‘Highest Network Access Quantity’ value.</p>
<p>The NAQ has no role in dispatch or settlement of the energy or ESS
markets, which will operate under the new Security Constrained Economic
Dispatch market model.</p>
<p>In accordance with the Miscellaneous Amendments No. 2, section 4.15
will be amended to '[Blank'] for the period from 1 March 2022 until the
amendments contained in the Tranches 2 and 3 Amendments (i.e. those set
out below) below commence on 1 September 2022.</p></th>

<th><p><strong>Explanatory Note</strong></p>
<p>Clause 4.15.1 requires AEMO to determine NAQs for relevant
Facilities.</p>
<p>A Facility’s NAQ is a function of:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>the Facility’s Certified Reserve Capacity; and</p></li>
<li><p>the network capacity that is available to accommodate the
Facility’s Certified Reserve Capacity.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Therefore, once AEMO has verified the performance capability of the
Facility (through the process of assigning Certified Reserve Capacity)
AEMO will then conduct an assessment (through a network capacity
modelling exercise) to determine how much of the Facility’s certified
output can be accommodated by the network.</p>
<p>Clause 4.15.5 will be replaced by the <em>Wholesale Electricity
Market Amendment (Tranche 5 Amendments) Rules 2021</em> (<strong>Tranche
5 Amendments</strong>) on 1 September 2022.</p>
<p>Tranche 6 Exposure Draft 1 included proposed amendments to ensure
that the facility dispatch scenarios developed by AEMO for use with the
Network Access Quantity Model consider Facilities with Early Certified
Reserve Capacity.</p>
<p>An additional issue with this clause was identified by AEMO after the
publication of Tranche 6 Exposure Draft 1. Depending on the relevant
Step in Appendix 3, a Facilities may be dispatched up to their Certified
Reserve Capacity or their Network Access Quantity assigned in the
previous Reserve Capacity Cycle. In the situation where either the total
assigned Certified Reserve Capacity or Network Access Quantities is less
than the peak demand it will be impossible for AEMO to satisfy clause
### 4.15.5(c).</p>
<p>For this reason, clause 4.15.5 is further amended to remove clause
### 4.15.5(c). How AEMO will create facility dispatch scenarios in a
shortfall situation will be covered in the Network Access Quantity WEM
Procedure.</p>
<p>Finally, following the consultation period for Tranche 6 Exposure
Draft 2, AEMO made a further suggestion to remove the requirement to
model NCESS for the creation of facility dispatch scenarios. AEMO
suggested to create Constraint Equations to ensure that during a solve,
the Facilities redispatch always meet the NCESS requirement. AEMO
considers that modelling the NCESS in the facility dispatch scenarios
may have an adverse impact that could result in overallocation of
Network Access Quantities to an NCESS Facility. In addition, the
solution using Constraint Equations is easier to implement and
consistent with the current design of the NAQ model.</p>
<p>In making its recommendation, AEMO (in consultation with Western
Power) considered whether it would be feasible to translate all possible
types of NCESS into Constraint Equations, considering the type of
constraint could be very different compared to Network thermal
constraints. AEMO and Western Power identified two scenarios where it
would not be possible to use a Constraint Equation to enforce an
NCESS:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>if the NCESS influences the dispatch of a Non Scheduled Facility
- note the NSF have a set dispatch value equal to their traded Certified
Reserve Capacity at any time, consistent with clause 4.15.9(d) that
requires AEMO to treat them as unconstrained; and</p></li>
<li><p>if the NCESS translates into a non-linear equation.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Both Western Power and AEMO do not foresee either of these scenarios
happening in the near future. In the event of an NCESS requiring either
the constraint of a NSF or to use a non-linear equation, AEMO would be
able to make modifications required to the NAQ model to account for it.
However, anticipating the design for this unlikely edge case would
require non-negligible effort and time and AEMO does not think this is
appropriate at this stage.</p></th>

<p>Clause 4.25.1 sets the Reserve Capacity testing obligations for
either a Facility or Separately Certified Component depending on whether
the Facility is required to install Facility Sub-Metering.</p>
<p>Clause 4.25.1(a), which now applies to all Scheduled Facilities or
Semi-Scheduled Facilities, details the level of output a
Non-Intermittent Generating System or Electric Storage Resource must
demonstrate to meet their Reserve Capacity testing obligations. A
Non-Intermittent Generating System and Electric Storage Resource must
demonstrate this level of output at least once in both the Summer and
Winter testing periods.</p>
<p>Clause 4.25.1(c) details the level of output a Demand Side Programme
must demonstrate to meet their Reserve Capacity testing obligations in
the Summer testing period only.</p>
<p>Clause 4.25.1A clarifies that an Intermittent Generating System or
Non-Scheduled Facility does not hold Reserve Capacity testing
obligations and therefore section 4.25 does not apply.</p>
<p>Clauses 4.25.3A and 4.25.9 are also amended by the Amending Rules
contained in the Rule Change Panel's Final Report for Rule Change
Proposal RC_2014_03 (Administrative Improvements to the Outage Process).
However, as this companion version of the WEM Rules only shows the
Tranches 2 and 3 Amendments as those amending rules (made by the
Minister at the date this companion version was prepared) will be
commenced last, please refer to the Final Report for Rule Change

<p>AEMO is required to schedule a random test of a DSP by giving two

AEMO is unlikely to be able to give precisely two hours' notice, so a

Network limitation.</p>

<p>Clause 4.26.1B sets out the calculation for the Real-Time Market
Reserve Capacity Deficit for a Facility for a Trading Interval. For
Scheduled Facilities and Semi-Scheduled Facilities, the Real-Time Market
Reserve Capacity Deficit is the lesser of the Facility’s RCOQ and the
sum of the following quantities:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Capacity Adjusted Forced Outage Quantity;</p></li>
<li><p>Not In-Service Capacity Refund Quantity;</p></li>

<li><p>Refund Payable Planned Outage quantity for Electric Storage

</ul>
<p>Clause 4.26.1B is further amended to remove references to
Non-Scheduled Facilities because the proposed changes to clause 4.26.1A
remove the need to calculate a Real-Time Market Reserve Capacity Deficit
value for a Non-Scheduled Facility.</p>
<p>Clauses 4.26.1B, 4.26.1C and 4.26.1CA are amended to:</p>
<ul>

<p>In the new WEM, Market Participants must offer adequate capacity into

Clause 4.26.1G requires AEMO to calculate Real‑Time Market Offer
Shortfall quantities for each Trading Interval for each Scheduled

<p>Industry feedback expressed the view that including real-time offer
shortfall calculations was not required as the requirement to lodge a
Forced Outage was still in place. It is correct that if a Forced Outage
is lodged no refund would apply under this calculation, but including
consideration of offer shortfalls means the shortfall will immediately
be reflected in settlement regardless of the timing or action of the

<th><p><strong>Explanatory Note</strong></p>
<p>Section 4.28C enables Market Participants with new facilities that
require a long lead time to apply to AEMO for early certification of
Reserve Capacity. Currently, an application may be made for eligible
facilities for a Capacity Year prior to 1 January of Year 1 of the
Reserve Capacity Cycle relating to that Capacity Year.</p>
<p>The ability for a Market Participant to make an application for early
certification of Reserve Capacity will continue subject to the following
key changes:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>applications may only be made up to two years before the start of
the relevant Reserve Capacity Cycle;</p></li>
<li><p>Market Participants will need to demonstrate to AEMO that the
project requires a lead time longer than the start of the Reserve
Capacity Cycle in which Capacity Credits are being sought for the
facility; and</p></li>
<li><p>eligible facilities will be assigned certified Reserve Capacity
and an Indicative NAQ. However, the number of Capacity Credits and a
Final NAQ will only be determined for the facility at the time, and in
accordance with, the standard processes and timeframes for the Reserve
Capacity Cycle in which Capacity Credits for the facility are being
sought.</p></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>For example, Capacity Credits for an application for Early Certified
Reserve Capacity that is submitted by a Market Participant in the 2021
Reserve Capacity Cycle – for which Capacity Credits are being sought for
the facility for the 2022 Reserve Capacity Cycle – will only be
determined and assigned to the facility by AEMO on 30 September
2022.</p>

<th><p><strong>Explanatory Note</strong></p>
<p>Clause 4.29.1 is amended as a consequence of the deletion of the
Reserve Capacity Auction, and to remove redundant references to previous
Reserve Capacity Cycles.</p>
<p>Clause 4.29.1 (and section 4.29) was amended pursuant to RCM Pricing
Reforms to accommodate the changes to the price to be paid for Reserve
Capacity from the 2019 Reserve Capacity Cycle. To facilitate the pricing
reforms, the clause was restructured so that clause 4.29.1 calculates
the annual Reserve Capacity Price, instead of a Facility Monthly Reserve
Capacity Price which is now calculated in accordance with clause
### 4.29.1A.</p>
<p>As a result of the RCM Pricing Reforms and the deletion of the
Reserve Capacity Auction, Facilities will receive the same Reserve
Capacity Price except in two situations.</p>
<p>Firstly, if the Facility is a Transitional Facility and the Reserve
Capacity Cycle is a Transitional Reserve Capacity Cycle, the Reserve
Capacity Price for the Facility will be as determined in accordance with
clause 4.29.1B. A Transitional Facility is an existing Facility (other
than a DSP) that was assigned Capacity Credits in the 2018 Reserve
Capacity Cycle. A Transitional Facility will be assigned Capacity
Credits at the Reserve Capacity Price subject to a floor of $114,000 and
a cap of $140,000. The cap and floor prices will be escalated in each of
the subsequent nine Reserve Capacity Cycles (i.e. up to and including
the 2028 Reserve Capacity Cycle) by the Reserve Bank of Australia's
Statement of Monetary Policy forecast Consumer Price Index for June of
Year 3 of the relevant Reserve Capacity Cycle in accordance with clause
### 4.29.1C.</p>
<p>Secondly, if the Facility is a Fixed Price Facility and the Reserve
Capacity Cycle is a Fixed Price Reserve Capacity Cycle for that Fixed
Price Facility, the Reserve Capacity Price for the Facility will be the
value determined in accordance with clause 4.29.1D. A Fixed Price
Facility is a Facility that will be assigned Capacity Credits at the
Reserve Capacity Price in the first Reserve Capacity Cycle in which it
is classified as a Fixed Price Facility. That Reserve Capacity Price
will be escalated in each of the subsequent four Reserve Capacity Cycles
by the Reserve Bank of Australia's Statement of Monetary Policy forecast
Consumer Price Index for June of Year 3 of the relevant Reserve Capacity
Cycle.</p>
<p>Upgrades of Facilities will receive the same Reserve Capacity Price
as the parent Facility unless the upgrade is a separate Facility for the
purposes of the WEM Rules. The main reason for this approach is the
absence of separate metering for the parent Facility and any associated
upgrade.</p>
<p>Clause 4.29.1(b) is further amended to correct a transcription error
by removing the brackets around ‘surplus + BRCP Cap Factor’.</p></th>

<p>Sections 4.30 and 4.31 are added to move capacity credit allocation
from chapter 9 (sections 9.4 and 9.5) to Chapter 4, changes in taxonomy,
change to clause references in Chapter 9. Changes also made to provide
clarity to Market Participants regarding the cut-off time.</p>
<p>The clause numbering in new sections 4.30 and 4.31 is consistent with
the numbering in sections 9.4 and 9.5.</p>
<p>Capacity Credit Allocations have changed from a monthly process which
was included in the consultation. AEMO identified implementation issues
where the monthly CCA would be effected by a transfer or reduction in
capacity credits late in the month which would have an impact on prior
trading week settlement.</p>
<p>Section 4.30 has been further amended as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The rules permit a participant to revise a CCA; however, they do
not require AEMO to check they have sufficient Capacity Credits to make
the revision. [4.30.6]. This undermines a key rule concept.</p></li>
<li><p>The rules allow participants to amend CCAs after the termination
of Capacity Credits; however, there are existing concepts that would
allow participants to do this (by withdrawing a CCA and submitting
another one). [4.30.10]. The current rule drafting for Capacity Credit
Allocation amendments adds implementation complexity for no benefit to
the market.</p></li>
<li><p>The rules put a 2 day deadline for CCA amendments to be resolved.
This was previously important, as changes to CCAs would impact a Market
Participant’s Trading Margin, and therefore is time-sensitive; however,
this is no longer the case. [4.30.10 and 4.30.11] The current rule
drafting for resolving Capacity Credit Allocation amendments within 2
days adds implementation complexity for no benefit to the
market.</p></li>
<li><p>The rules put a requirement for AEMO to amend CCAs by 5PM on the
Scheduling Day if a participant does not amend the CCAs by 5PM on the
Scheduling Day. [4.30.11] This makes it impossible for AEMO to comply
with the obligation by amending them exactly at 5PM on the Scheduling
Day.</p></li>
<li><p>The current drafting also explicitly refers to terminations
identified in clause 4.30.9. It should be written more generally to
