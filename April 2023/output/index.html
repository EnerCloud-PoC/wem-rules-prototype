<p><strong>PLEASE NOTE: THIS IS NOT AN OFFICIAL VERSION OF THE</strong></p>
<p><strong>WHOLESALE ELECTRICITY MARKET RULES.</strong></p>
<p><strong>This document is a compilation of the Wholesale Electricity Market
Rules that are intended to be in force from commencement of the new
Market. As such, this document may not show <abbr title="Wholesale Energy Market. The market established under section 122 of the Electricity Industry Act.">WEM</abbr> Rules (including
amendments to them) that apply up until that time.</strong></p>
<p><strong>CONSOLIDATED 'COMPANION' VERSION OF THE</strong></p>

Rules</u></strong> reflects the Wholesale Electricity Market Rules ('WEM
Rules') that, subject to any subsequent amendments after the date this
'companion' version was prepared, are intended to be in force from
commencement of the new Market.</p>
<p>The amendments made by the Minister for Energy (under regulation 7(5)
of the <em>Electricity Industry (Wholesale Electricity Market)
Regulations 2004</em>) that give effect to the Wholesale Electricity
Market Reforms are shown in this version as follows:</p>

<p>This 'companion' version of the WEM Rules shows the Amending Rules as
implemented from commencement of the new Market. Therefore, amendments
that delete entire clauses or sections or transitional Amending Rules
which are to be deleted prior to the commencement of the new Market are
not shown and users should refer to the relevant Ministerial Instruments
to see those amendments. However, where an amendment only comprises a
partial deletion of a clause, the clause is shown in 'green' or 'blue',
as applicable, until it is commenced (when it will be shown in
'black').</p>

<p>The reforms to registration include requiring various participants to
register in different classes to ensure that the relevant obligations
are placed on individual participants or a group of participants with
similar characteristics (in respect of facilities they own, control or
operate). A new registration taxonomy is to be introduced into the WEM.
However, transitional provisions are required so that the new
registration taxonomy applies to Market Participants participating in
the Reserve Capacity Mechanism for the 2021, 2022 and 2023 Reserve
Capacity Cycles.</p>
<p>Section 1.45 enables the new registration taxonomy to apply to the
2021, 2022 and 2023 RCM Capacity Cycles while maintaining the existing
registration concepts under the current market arrangements until the
New WEM Commencement Day, which is when the new registration taxonomy
will apply.</p>
<p>The intent of section 1.45 is set out below.</p>
<ul>
<li><blockquote>
<p>Automatically transition (via deeming provisions) all existing Market
Participants (e.g. Market Generators and Market Customers registered
under the current WEM Rules) participating in the 2021, 2022 and 2023
Reserve Capacity Cycles to the relevant RCM Market Participant
class.</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote>
<p>Automatically transition (via deeming provisions) all existing Market
Participants' Registered Facilities to new equivalent Facility Classes
unless certain conditions apply. Where those conditions apply, the
transitional WEM Procedure will apply and AEMO will be required to
determine a different Facility Class as per the new Facility Classes
specified in new section 2.29.</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote>
<p>If there is an existing unregistered facility, the facility will be
assessed as per the new Facility Technology Types specified in new
section 2.29 and will be assigned a Facility Class.</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote>
<p>Any new facility participating in the Reserve Capacity Mechanism for
the first time will be required to follow the processes under Chapter
4.</p>

<p>Changes to clause 2.16.2A allow the ERA to provide AEMO a list of WEM
Rules that AEMO must monitor for compliance, and new clause 2.16.2AA
allows AEMO and the ERA to negotiate on the types of information
included (based on practicality and cost) and the time and date this

the ERA more flexibility in directing AEMO to monitor compliance with
Rule changes where AEMO is the party best placed to do so, and for this
list of WEM Rules monitoring by AEMO to change over time to remain more
relevant as the market evolves. Transparency will be provided to Market
Participants on the types of information being provided through the

<p>Market Power Mitigation</p>
<p>2.16A. General Trading Obligations</p>
<p>2.16A.1. A Market Participant must offer prices in each of its STEM
Submissions and Real‑Time Market Submissions that reflect only the costs
that a Market Participant without market power would include in forming
profit-maximising price offers in a STEM Submission or Real-Time Market
Submission.</p>
<p>2.16A.2. The <abbr title="The body established under section 4(1) of the Economic Regulation Authority Act (WA).">Economic Regulation Authority</abbr> must not determine that a
Market Participant has engaged in conduct prohibited by clause 2.16A.1
unless the <abbr title="The body established under section 4(1) of the Economic Regulation Authority Act (WA).">Economic Regulation Authority</abbr> has first determined that the
Market Participant had market power at the time of offering the relevant
prices in its STEM Submission or Real‑Time Market Submission.</p>
<p>2.16A.3. A Market Participant must not engage in conduct in the STEM or
Real-Time Market that:</p>
<p><span class="arithmatex">\(a\)</span> is false, misleading or deceptive, or likely to mislead or
deceive;</p>
<p><span class="arithmatex">\(b\)</span> is fraudulent, dishonest or in bad faith; or</p>
<p><span class="arithmatex">\(c\)</span> has the purpose, or has or is likely to have the effect, of
distorting or manipulating prices in the Wholesale Electricity Market.</p>
<p>2.16A.4. In determining whether a Market Participant has engaged in
conduct prohibited by clause 2.16A.3, the <abbr title="The body established under section 4(1) of the Economic Regulation Authority Act (WA).">Economic Regulation Authority</abbr>
may take into account:</p>
<p><span class="arithmatex">\(a\)</span> historical STEM Submissions or Real-Time Market Submissions made

<p><span class="arithmatex">\(d\)</span> any other information the <abbr title="The body established under section 4(1) of the Economic Regulation Authority Act (WA).">Economic Regulation Authority</abbr> considers
relevant to its determination.</p>
<p>2.16A.5. A STEM Submission or a Real-Time Market Submission is not made
in bad faith under clause 2.16A.3(b) if, at the time it is submitted,
the Market Participant had a genuine intention to honour the terms of
that STEM Submission or Real-Time Market Submission if the material
conditions and circumstances upon which the STEM Submission or Real-Time
Market Submission was based remained unchanged until the relevant
Trading Interval.</p>
<p>2.16A.6. A Market Participant may be taken to have made a STEM
Submission or a Real‑Time Market Submission in bad faith notwithstanding
that the intention of the Market Participant is ascertainable only by
inference from:</p>
<p><span class="arithmatex">\(a\)</span> the conduct of the Market Participant;</p>
<p><span class="arithmatex">\(b\)</span> the conduct of any other person; or</p>
<p><span class="arithmatex">\(c\)</span> the relevant circumstances.</p>
<p>2.16A.7. If a Market Participant does not have reasonable grounds for a
price, quantity, or Ramp Rate Limit, as applicable, it has included in a
Real-Time Market Submission at the time it submits that Real-Time Market
Submission, then the Market Participant is, for the purposes of clause
2.16A.3(a), taken to have known that the Real-Time Market Submission was
likely to lead to another <abbr title="Any person registered as a Rule Participant in accordance with Chapter 2 and AEMO.">Rule Participant</abbr> being misled or deceived as
to the existence or non-existence of a material fact relating to the
Real‑Time Market.</p>
<p>2.16A.8. For the purposes of clause 2.16A.7, a Market Participant must
adduce evidence that it had reasonable grounds for including a price,
quantity or Ramp Rate Limit, as applicable, in the Real-Time Market
Submission. To avoid doubt, the effect of this clause is to place an
evidentiary burden on a Market Participant, and this clause does not
have the effect that, merely because such evidence is adduced, the
Market Participant who submitted the Real-Time Market Submission is
taken to have had reasonable grounds for including a price, quantity or
Ramp Rate Limit, as applicable.</p>
<p>2.16A.9. Clause 2.16A.7 does not imply that merely because a Market
Participant had reasonable grounds for making the representation or the
conduct referred to in Chapter 7, in respect of the Real-Time Market,
and in particular putting the price, quantity or Ramp Rate Limit, as
applicable, in a Real-Time Market Submission submitted by the Market
Participant, that such representation or conduct is not misleading.</p>

<th><p><strong>Explanatory Note</strong></p>
<p>In order not to unnecessarily delay processes or introduce a decision
maker other than AEMO and the relevant Network Operator in respect of
generator performance standards, certain parts of Chapter 3A will not be
subject to the general ability to raise a dispute under the WEM Rules.
These are:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>a decision to exempt generating works connected to a transmission
system;</p></li>
<li><p>a decision to refuse to renegotiate a Registered Generator
Performance Standard;</p></li>
<li><p>a decision in respect of a Rectification Plan; and</p></li>
<li><p>a decision to declare a Potential Relevant Generation
Modification to be a Relevant Generator Modification.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Clause 2.18.1 is amended to remove the dispute resolution mechanism
in section 1.42 for Existing Transmission Connected Market Generators
from the dispute process so that the dispute resolution mechanism in
section 1.42 is the only mechanism to resolve such disputes (other than
any rights a party has under law). Decisions by AEMO as to extensions to
submit a Generator Monitoring Plan under clause 1.41.4 will also be
exempt from the disputes regime.</p>
<p>Clause 2.18.1 is further amended to exclude disputes about Market
Information, which are dealt with under section 10.5.</p></th>

<th><p><strong>Explanatory Note</strong></p>
<p>Section 2.22A. is amended to address the shortcomings with the
current rules relating to the determination of AEMO’s budget. This
includes replacing transitional rules with the specific function to
facilitate and prepare for Market Evolution.</p>
<p>The current rules are restrictive for the Regulator (limited
discretion in determining if individual projects are prudent, limited
review and information gathering time/powers). This has resulted in
poorly evidenced submissions with the onus on the ERA to determine
efficient funding levels.</p>
<p>The amendments will seek to achieve the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>enable regulatory scrutiny and enhance transparency by:</p></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><p>identifying projects/functions and related costs up front;
and</p></li>
<li><p>increasing transparency over funding allocation and actual
expenditures;</p></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><p>deal with uncertainty by allowing partial approvals and limited
in-period reopening; and</p></li>

<th><p><strong>Explanatory Note</strong></p>
<p>To support the Taskforce design decision to incorporate a lifecycle
approach to registration, Market Participants will be required to notify
AEMO whenever the configuration of their Facility changes as this may
affect the classification of the Facility.</p>
<p>Under the new arrangements registration will need to be an ongoing
process from Facility creation to deregistration. This is to ensure that
AEMO has the information required to inform scheduling and dispatch
while maintaining system security, and that necessary obligations apply
to a Facility through the operation of the WEM Rules.</p>
<p>New provisions have been incorporated to outline the Facility Class
reassessment process to be followed by Market Participants and AEMO.</p>
<p>Clause 2.29.6 outlines the process under the WEM Rules by which a
Market Participant may trigger a Facility Class reassessment request for
a Registered Facility.</p>
<p>The scope of clauses 2.29.6 excludes Demand Side Programmes and
Interruptible Loads, as Facilities registered in these Facility Classes
are not subject to the reclassification if the configuration of their
Facility changes. Instead, for Demand Side Programmes and Interruptible
Loads, a Market Participant or AEMO may trigger the Load association and
or the disassociation process in accordance with clause 2.29.5 and
changes to the configuration of an Interruptible Load will require ESS
re-accreditation.</p>
<p>Requirements have also been updated in sections 2.31 and 2.33 to
incorporate the Facility Class reassessment process initiated by a
Market Participant and the required application form.</p></th>

<p>The scope of section 2.30 therefore only covers the aggregation of

<p>Clause 2.30.5(c) is a consequential amendment as a result of the new
Essential System Services framework, which does not use the term
‘Ancillary Service Contract’.</p>
<p>Clause 2.30.5(f) precludes AEMO from aggregating, or allowing to
continue to be aggregated, Facilities where the price for Reserve
Capacity to be provided by those Facilities is not, or is not expected
to be, the same.</p>
<p>Section 3.1.1 of the Energy Scheduling and Dispatch Information paper
sets out the criteria that AEMO must apply when approving the
aggregation of Facilities, so that the locational dispatch and
co-optimisation of ESS envisaged by the SCED reforms can be
effected.</p>
<p>Paragraph (g) of clause 2.30.5 represents this intent, and is
intended to convey the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>AEMO cannot approve an aggregation that would lead to the
over-procurement of Contingency Reserve Raise ESS as a result of
reflecting the output of the Aggregated Facility as the contingency (in
the relevant ESS constraint) in SCED when the credible contingency is
the individual loss of each component Facility. This is not an issue
when the aggregation is so small, that the impact on Contingency Reserve
Raise ESS procurement is negligible or nil.</p></li>
<li><p>AEMO cannot approve an aggregation where the Aggregated Facility
would be providing ESS, and the ESS capability (ESS trapezium) cannot be
accurately depicted for the Aggregated Facility in its entirety. It
should be noted the Facility capable of providing ESS, must offer its
ESS quantity at its connection points for the whole Facility, not at the
Facility’s sub-component level.</p></li>
<li><p>AEMO may only aggregate Facilities if the proposed Aggregated
Facility are at the same Electrical Location. Figure 1 and Figure 2
below illustrate configurations in which aggregation is allowed and not
allowed.</p></li>

<p>In addition, clause 2.30.5 (b) has been amended slightly to clarify
the fact that:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The aggregation may comprise both registered and unregistered
Facilities; and</p></li>
<li><p>AEMO may require Standing Data in respect of the aggregation as
opposed to just the individual Facilities comprising the

<p>New clauses 2.34.12, 2.34.12A and 2.34.12B align with EPWA’s policy
intent to incorporate a lifecycle approach to registration and

<p>Clause 2.34.12 gives AEMO the power to utilise Standing Data to

and requirements of Standing Data.</p>
<p>Clause 2.34.12A interlinks a change in Standing Data with the process
outlined under section 2.29 ‘Facility Class reassessments’ which may be
triggered by AEMO. This is to provide transparency that Standing Data
may be used as part of this process.</p>
<p>Clause 2.34.12B gives AEMO the power to confirm the Standing Data is
accurate from a person who is exempt from the requirement to register or

<p>Replacement section 3.6 outlines the obligations of AEMO and Network
Operators in relation to managing under frequency load shedding on the
SWIS. AEMO is required to prepare and publish an UFLS Requirements
document to set out the aggregate under frequency load shedding
requirements for the SWIS taking into account the SWIS Frequency

<th><p><strong>Explanatory Note</strong></p>
<p>The primary objective of the new Non-Co-optimised Essential System
Services (NCESS) framework outlined in the Taskforce Paper: A Framework
for Non-Co-optimised Essential System Service is to enable AEMO and
Western Power to identify and justify the need for an ESS not already
available through existing market mechanisms, and to procure those
services in a transparent and efficient manner.</p>
<p>The NCESS framework outlines:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>the roles of the Coordinator, AEMO and Western Power under the
NCESS framework;</p></li>
<li><p>the conditions associated with power system security and
reliability and market costs that would require Western Power and/or
AEMO to trigger an NCESS procurement process;</p></li>
<li><p>Western Power’s and AEMO’s obligations to consult with the
Coordinator of Energy to seek confirmation to trigger an NCESS
procurement process;</p></li>
<li><p>the procurement process that Western Power and AEMO must follow
to procure NCESS;</p></li>
<li><p>the obligations that NCESS Contract holders must follow;</p></li>
<li><p>the rules for NCESS dispatch and settlement; and</p></li>
<li><p>the obligation for Western Power to prepare a Transmission System
Plan.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>An Interim NCESS Framework will commence on 1 February 2022 and apply
until New WEM Commencement Day. As this Companion Version of the WEM
Rules contains the provisions that will apply from the start of the new
market, please see Schedule B of the Tranche 5 Amendments for the
amendments comprising the interim framework (i.e. sections 3.11A and
3.11B) that will apply until that time.</p>
<p>This Framework will replace the concept of Dispatch Support Service
contract with an AEMO-procured NCESS contract (i.e., it is no longer an
Ancillary Service), and a Network Control Service contract with a
Network Operator-procured NCESS Contract.</p>
<p>The intent is that any Dispatch Support Service or Network Control
Service contracts entered into after 1 February 2022 will have the
following obligations applied to them:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>AEMO and Western Power will trigger the procurement of
AEMO-procured and NO-procured NCESS respectively. New clauses for
trigger conditions have been drafted (see interim clause 3.11A.2 and
3.11A.2A);</p></li>
<li><p>the Coordinator may also trigger at any time based on certain
trigger conditions (see interim clause 3.11A.4);</p></li>
<li><p>the Coordinator will approve the trigger. The ERA will no longer
have a role in approving AEMO’s trigger for procuring NCESS;</p></li>
<li><p>be procured under the new NCESS procurement framework outlined in
section 3.11B; and</p></li>
<li><p>dispatched and settled as per current processes.</p></li>

<p>3.11A. Triggering Procurement of Non-Co-optimised Essential System

<th><p><strong>Explanatory Note</strong></p>
<p>Clause 3.11A.2 outlines the trigger conditions under which Western
Power or AEMO or both must assess and determine whether to make a
written submission to the Coordinator to trigger the NCESS Procurement
process.</p>
<p>Either entity could form a view that a trigger condition applies, and
it must then make a written submission to the Coordinator. Allowing
either entity to apply to the Coordinator provides a level of guarantee
that at least one entity will seek to trigger, even if the other entity
does not believe the trigger condition applies.</p>
<p>Once a written submission is made to the Coordinator, the Coordinator
may request either or both entities to provide more information or
undertake analysis to assist the Coordinator in deciding whether to
trigger an NCESS procurement process.</p>
<p>Clause 3.11A.2 is amended to improve coordination between AEMO and
Network Operators by requiring a Network Operator to notify AEMO before
the Network Operator makes a submission to request the Coordinator to
determine whether to trigger an NCESS procurement process.</p>
<p>Section 3.11A is expected to be replaced on New WEM Commencement Day
by the <em>Wholesale Electricity Market Amendment (Tranche 5 Amendments)
Rules 2021</em> (Schedule I, paragraph 17.1). Following this
replacement, further amendments will be required to reapply the changes
described in Part 1 of this Exposure Draft to clauses 3.11A.2 (which
replaces clauses 3.11A.2 and 3.11A.2A) and 3.11A.3(b).</p></th>

<p>Western Power and AEMO will be responsible for developing the service
specification to procure NCESS. The NCESS procurement process will be a
two-stage process where a draft service specification must be published
on the relevant website and respondents will have the opportunity to
express their interest. This step will enable Western Power and AEMO to
determine whether any suitable providers exist and what solutions they
can provide to meet fully or partially the requirements. Suitability may
depend on several factors such as the type of technology, network
location, operational limitations etc. If suitable providers are not
found, the service specification may need to be modified, or the NCESS
procurement may be postponed or may not proceed.</p>
<p>If the NCESS procurement is to proceed based on the expressions of
interest received, AEMO or Western Power as applicable will issue a
request for tender and a final service specification will then be
published to commence the procurement process. New providers that did
not participate in the first step can also apply.</p>

provided the AEMO would not be able decide whether the proposed Facility
is capable of being assigned Certified Reserve Capacity and Capacity
Credits. Further, clause 3.11B.7(iA) is included to enable a proponent
to request reimbursement for any reduction in a Reserve Capacity
settlement amount that is a direct consequence of the enablement or
dispatch of the NCESS (e.g. in the event NCESS services provided by
storage are enabled outside of the ESR obligation intervals). The
drafting of clause 3.11B.7(iA) is amended from the version presented in
Exposure Draft 2 to take into account all the impacts of a Forced Outage
on Reserve Capacity settlement amounts, e.g. the return of a share of
Capacity Cost Refunds to a Market Participant through Participant
Capacity Rebates.</p>
<p>Clause 3.11B.7 is also amended to correct minor typographical and
grammatical errors and use standard terminology.</p></th>

<th><p><strong>Explanatory Note</strong></p>
<p>New section 3.15A sets out the regime for the new SESSM for procuring
FCESS. This new regime replaces the current contract-based
mechanism.</p>
<p>Set out below is an extract from the Taskforce’s Information Paper
<em>Supplementary ESS Procurement Mechanism</em> to provide some
background to the new regime. You should refer to the Information Paper
for further details.</p>
<p>FCESS will be primarily procured via real-time markets, with
participation from all capable and accredited facilities enabled, but
not mandatory. Nevertheless, to protect against the risk of market
failure in what will be relatively small and concentrated markets, the
Taskforce has endorsed the SESSM to provide a means for longer-term
contractual arrangements to increase certainty, mitigate inefficient
market outcomes, support new market entry, and avoid a shortfall in ESS
accreditation and participation. Contrasting with current arrangements,
the SESSM will be implemented through a transparent tender process in

<p>The broad objectives of the SESSM are to:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>incentivise new FCESS providers to enter the market;</p></li>
<li><p>mitigate scarcity in FCESS markets, manifesting either as a
shortfall of accredited facilities, or shortfall of participation;
and</p></li>
<li><p>mitigation of market power by:</p></li>

<ul>
<li><blockquote>
<p>the threat of competitive entry; and</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote>
<p>a mechanism of ex-ante review of the operating costs of ESS providers
by the Economic Regulation Authority.</p>
</blockquote></li>
</ul>
<p>The procurement of SESSM broadly consists of seven stages:
Triggering, SESSM Service Specification, Veto of Procurement,
Procurement Process, Selection, Veto of Award, and SESSM.</p></th>

<p>Section 3.15B sets out the regime for a new periodic expressions of
interest process to provide a benchmark for market pricing of ESS. It
sets out a market sounding process in order for AEMO to test the market.
It will not result in the award of SESSM Award but it will assist the
ERA to determine whether the current market price is appropriate and
whether there is a need to trigger the SESSM. Additionally, the process
provides engagement with new facilities to understand the accreditation
process and allows participants to prepare submissions in readiness for
a short lead-time SESSM procurement.</p>
<p>The expressions of interest process is to be run by AEMO but it is
noted that AEMO doesn’t use the information collected through the
process for any SESSM trigger. Instead, it passes the information on to
the ERA.</p>
<p>It is anticipated that the first expressions of interest process will
be run in early 2022, and transitional rules will be developed to
support and give effect to that process.</p></th>

<p>The definition for 'Outage' is amended in clause 3.18.3. The
definition builds on the definitions of “unavailability” introduced by
Rule Change Proposals RC_2013_15 and RC_2014_03, but has been
restructured to specifically relate to the definition of an Outage.</p>
<p>The Tranches 2 and 3 Amendments created a requirement for Demand Side
Programmes with Capacity Credits to be included on the Equipment
List.</p>
<p>However, the outage quantity calculations in clauses 3.21.6 to
3.21.8B do not work properly for Demand Side Programmes and produce
capacity adjusted outage quantities that are always equal to zero. While
the outage quantity calculations could be enhanced to account for Demand
Side Programmes properly, the calculation of a non-zero Forced Outage
quantity for a Demand Side Programme would not lead to payment of
Capacity Cost Refunds because the current refund calculations for Demand
Side Programmes in section 4.26 do not consider Forced Outage
quantities.</p>
<p>Addressing these issues would require material changes, which could
be superseded by the outcomes of the RCM Review. For this reason, Energy
Policy WA proposes to make the following changes to clauses 3.18.3,
3.18.4 and 3.18A.3 to remove Demand Side Programmes from the Equipment
List, and to reconsider the treatment of Demand Side Programme outages
more holistically as part of the RCM Review.</p>
<p>Clause 3.18.3 is further amended to clarify:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>that Outages of components of an Outage Facility (e.g. a specific
Facility Technology Type) are covered by the Equipment Limits of that
Facility;</p></li>
<li><p>that the limitation around having to submit Outages for
Semi-Scheduled Facilities and Non‑Scheduled Facilities applies only to
Facilities that contain an Intermittent Generating System;</p></li>
<li><p>the references to Standing Data items in clause 3.18.2(c)(ii);

<p>Section 3A.5 sets out the approval process and negotiation framework
for determining generator performance standards for Market Participants
wishing to connect generating systems to the transmission network. The
applicable standards are set out as Technical Requirements under
Appendix 12. For most Technical Requirements, there is an Ideal
Generator Performance Standard and a Minimum Generator Performance
Standard. The Network Operator must accept a Proposed Generator
Performance Standard that meets the Ideal Generator Performance Standard
and must reject any proposed standard below the Minimum Generator
Performance Standard. Where a Proposed Generator Performance Standard is
between the range of minimum and ideal, the generator must adequately
justify why it cannot achieve the Ideal Generator Performance Standard.
The Network Operator must consult with AEMO on any negotiated standard
that it is likely to accept, and is not permitted to accept the standard
unless AEMO also agrees. If rejecting a Proposed Generator Performance
Standard, the Network Operator and AEMO must provide reasons.</p>
<p>A Market Participant may propose a Trigger Event. If an approved
Trigger Event occurs then the Market Participant must comply with the
conditions of the Trigger Event.</p>
<p>Once approved, the generator performance standards for a Transmission
Connected Generating System must be recorded on the Generator

<p>3B.2.2. The Normal Operating Frequency Excursion Band is an allowable
frequency operating range where no action or response is required by
<abbr title="Australian Energy Market Operator">AEMO</abbr> for infrequent or momentary excursions outside of the Normal
Operating Frequency Band. The frequency operating range and duration are
set out in Table 1, Appendix 13 for the SWIS.</p>
<p>3B.2.3. The Credible Contingency Event Frequency Band is the allowable
frequency operating range where there has been a Credible Contingency
Event on the SWIS. The frequency operating range and duration are set
out in Table 1, Appendix 13 for the SWIS and Table 2, Appendix 13 for an
Island.</p>
<p>3B.2.4. The Island Separation Frequency Band is the allowable frequency
operating range immediately following a Separation Event on the SWIS
which creates one or more Islands. The frequency operating range and
duration are set out in Table 1, Appendix 13 for the SWIS and Table 2,
Appendix 13 for an Island.</p>
<p>3B.2.5. The Extreme Frequency Tolerance Band represents the frequency
operating range that applies to the SWIS Frequency in respect of clause

<p>3B.3. Required SWIS Frequency outcomes</p>
<p>3B.3.1. Other than for an Island, while in an Emergency Operating State
or during a system restart, the Accumulated Time Error must be less than
10 seconds for 99% of the time over any rolling 30-day period in the
SWIS.</p>
<p>3B.3.2. Subject to clause 3B.3.3, the SWIS Frequency must not exceed the
Normal Operating Frequency Band in accordance with the relevant
requirements set out in Table 1, Appendix 13 for the SWIS and Table 2,
Appendix 13 for an Island.</p>
<p>3B.3.3. The SWIS Frequency may exceed the relevant Normal Operating
Frequency Band following the occurrence of a Contingency Event.</p>
<p>3B.3.4. Subject to clause 3B.3.8, the SWIS Frequency must not exceed the
Normal Operating Frequency Excursion Band, and must Stabilise, in
accordance with the relevant requirements set out in Table 1, Appendix
13 for the SWIS and Table 2, Appendix 13 for an Island.</p>
<p>3B.3.5. Subject to clause 3B.3.6, for any Credible Contingency Event,
the SWIS Frequency must not exceed the relevant rate of change
requirements set out in Table 1, Appendix 13 for the SWIS and Table 2,
Appendix 13 for an Island.</p>
<p>3B.3.6. Clause 3B.3.5 does not apply to the initial formation of an
Island following a Separation Event.</p>
<p>3B.3.7. Subject to clause 3B.3.8, the SWIS Frequency must not exceed the
Credible Contingency Event Frequency Band, and must Stabilise and
Recover, in accordance with the relevant requirements set out in Table
1, Appendix 13 for the SWIS and Table 2, Appendix 13 for an Island.</p>
<p>3B.3.8. For the avoidance of doubt, the requirements in clause 3B.3.4
and clause 3B.3.7 do not apply where a Multiple Contingency Event
occurs.</p>
<p>3B.3.9. Following a Separation Event, an Island is permitted to be
temporarily de-energised with frequency subsequently required to be
restored to the relevant requirements set out in Table 2, Appendix 13
for an Island as soon as practicable.</p>
<p>3B.3.10. Subject to clause 3B.3.9, if there is a Separation Event, SWIS
Frequency must not exceed the Island Separation Frequency Band, and must
Stabilise and Recover, in accordance with the relevant requirements set
out in Table 1, Appendix 13 for the SWIS and Table 2, Appendix 13 for an
Island.</p>
<p>3B.3.11. For a Non-Credible Contingency Event or Multiple Contingency
Event, reasonable endeavours must be taken to maintain the SWIS
Frequency in accordance with the Extreme Frequency Tolerance Band, and
to Stabilise and Recover the SWIS Frequency in accordance with the
relevant requirements set out in Table 1, Appendix 13 for the SWIS and
Table 2, Appendix 13 for an Island. For the avoidance of doubt, the use
of load shedding is acceptable in order to meet the requirements of this
clause 3B.3.11.</p>
<p>3B.3.12. Based on the readings recorded in <abbr title="Australian Energy Market Operator">AEMO</abbr>’s SCADA system, a
Contingency Event, including a Credible Contingency Event, Separation
Event, commences at the time SWIS Frequency exceeds the frequencies in
the Normal Operating Frequency Excursion Band set out in Table 1,
Appendix 13 for the SWIS and Table 2, Appendix 13 for an Island, and
ends at the time at which SWIS Frequency Recovers.</p>
<p>3B.3.13. For the avoidance of doubt, reasonable endeavours in this
section 3B.3 includes allowance for avoiding pre-contingent load
shedding, or to prioritise restoration of load, over meeting the
Frequency Operating Standards in an Island.</p>

<p><strong>Network Access Quantity</strong></p>
<p>AEMO is required to determine an initial Network Access Quantity for
each Facility (other than a GIA Facility) that was assigned Capacity
Credits for the 2021 Reserve Capacity Cycle.</p>
<p>The initial Network Access Quantity for a Facility will be the lower
of:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>the Capacity Credits held for the Facility for the 2021 Reserve
Capacity Cycle; and</p></li>
<li><p>the Certified Reserve Capacity that AEMO has assigned to the
Facility for the 2022 Reserve Capacity Cycle.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The purpose of the initial Network Access Quantity is to give
existing holders of Capacity Credits priority over new entrants (which
includes any upgrades to existing Facilities) for the purposes of
determining Network Access Quantities for Facilities for the 2022
Reserve Capacity Cycle.</p>
<p>The initial Network Access Quantity determined for a Facility does
not set the Network Access Quantity to be determined for the Facility in
any subsequent Reserve Capacity Cycle.</p>
<p><strong>CC Uplift Quantity</strong></p>
<p>The WEM Rules include a supplementary mechanism to ‘uplift’ the
allocation assigned to a Facility in the 2021 Reserve Capacity Cycle.
The ‘Capacity Credit Uplift’ only applies to non GIA Facilities.  The
uplift represents the difference between an initial NAQ value determined
for a Facility (in accordance with Step 3(a) of Appendix 3) and the
Capacity Credits assigned to the Facility in the 2021 Reserve Capacity
Cycle, but is only provided up to the amount of Certified Reserve
Capacity assigned to the Facility in the Reserve Capacity Cycle that NAQ
is first assigned.</p>
<p>Capacity Credit Uplift Quantities are treated the same as Capacity
Credits for the purpose of the WEM Rules except that they will not be
taken into account when AEMO determines whether the Reserve Capacity
Requirement has been met.</p>
<p>The sum of a Facility’s NAQ and its Capacity Credit Uplift must not
exceed the Facility’s Certified Reserve Capacity.  If the sum of the NAQ
and the Capacity Credit Uplift exceeds the Certified Reserve Capacity
for the Facility, then the amount of the Capacity Credit Uplift will be
reduced.</p></th>

‘required’ quantity for that Market Participant and Trading
Interval.</p>
<p>The quantity of capacity deemed to have been provided is determined
using the CAPASTEM(p,t) calculation in clause 4.26.2AE, which
incorporates:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>the Market Participant’s Net Contract Position;</p></li>
<li><p>STEM Offers that were not scheduled in the STEM Auction;
and</p></li>
<li><p>STEM Bids that were scheduled in the STEM Auction.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The required quantity is determined using the STEMREQ(p,t)
calculation in clause 4.26.2AB. STEMREQ(p,t) is based on the STEM
Reserve Capacity Obligation Quantities of the Market Participant’s
Scheduled Facilities and Semi-Scheduled Facilities, with an adjustment
to account for capacity that was available in real time but was expected
by AEMO to be subject to a Forced Outage when AEMO estimated Capacity
Adjusted Forced Outage Quantities for the Trading Day on the relevant
Scheduling Day.</p>
<p>Note that clause 4.12.1 as set out in the Tranche 5 Amendments
(Schedule I, paragraph 27.1) supersedes the amendments to clauses
4.12.1(a)-(c) as set out in the Tranches 2 and 3 Amendments (Schedule C,
paragraph 87.1). However, the Tranche 5 Amendments contains an error in
that the instruction deletes clause 4.12.1 but only replaces it with
subclauses (a) and (b) and not also with the opening paragraph.</p>
<p>To achieve the intended outcome, the Tranches 2 and 3 Amendments and
Tranche 5 Amendments to clause 4.12.1 will not be commenced. Instead the
Tranche 6 Amendments will replace the existing clause 4.12.1.</p></th>

<p>4.13A. DSM Reserve Capacity Security</p>
<p>4.13A.1. Where <abbr title="Australian Energy Market Operator">AEMO</abbr> assigns Certified Reserve Capacity to a Demand Side
Programme, the relevant Market Participant must ensure that <abbr title="Australian Energy Market Operator">AEMO</abbr> holds
the benefit of DSM Reserve Capacity Security that is:</p>
<p><span class="arithmatex">\(a\)</span> where:</p>
<p>i. clause 4.1.13 applies, for an amount determined under clause
4.13A.2(a) by the date and time referred to in clause 4.1.13; or</p>
<p>ii. clause 4.1.21 applies, for an amount determined under clause
4.13A.2(b) by the date and time referred to in clause 4.1.21; and</p>
<p><span class="arithmatex">\(b\)</span> in the form specified in clause 4.13A.6.</p>
<p>4.13A.2. For the purposes of this section 4.13A, the amount of DSM
Reserve Capacity Security is:</p>
<p><span class="arithmatex">\(a\)</span> 25 percent of the Benchmark Reserve Capacity Price included in the
Request for Expressions of Interest issued for the relevant Reserve
Capacity Cycle, expressed in $/MW per year, multiplied by an amount
equal to:</p>
<p>i. the Certified Reserve Capacity assigned to the Demand Side
Programme; less</p>
<p>ii. the total of any Certified Reserve Capacity amount specified in
accordance with clause 4.14.1(d) or referred to in clause 4.14.7(c)(ii);
or</p>
<p><span class="arithmatex">\(b\)</span> 25 percent of the Benchmark Reserve Capacity Price included in the
Request for Expressions of Interest issued for the relevant Reserve
Capacity Cycle, expressed in $/MW per year, multiplied by an amount
equal to the total number of Capacity Credits assigned to the Demand
Side Programme under clause 4.20.5A.</p>
<p>4.13A.3. Where:</p>
<p><span class="arithmatex">\(a\)</span> <abbr title="Australian Energy Market Operator">AEMO</abbr> holds the benefit of a DSM Reserve Capacity Security in
accordance with this section 4.13A in respect of a Demand Side Programme
for a Reserve Capacity Cycle; and</p>
<p><span class="arithmatex">\(b\)</span> <abbr title="Australian Energy Market Operator">AEMO</abbr> assigns Certified Reserve Capacity to the same Demand Side
Programme for a subsequent Reserve Capacity Cycle,</p>
<p>then the DSM Reserve Capacity Security for the previous Reserve Capacity
Cycle will be deemed to satisfy the requirement in clause 4.13A.1 for
<abbr title="Australian Energy Market Operator">AEMO</abbr> to have the benefit of DSM Reserve Capacity Security for the
subsequent Reserve Capacity Cycle if:</p>
<p><span class="arithmatex">\(c\)</span> the amount of the DSM Reserve Capacity Security complies with
clause 4.13A.4; and</p>
<p><span class="arithmatex">\(d\)</span> the DSM Reserve Capacity Security remains in force at all relevant
times for the purposes of this section 4.13A.</p>
<p>4.13A.4. Subject to clause 4.13A.5, where a Market Participant is
required to ensure that <abbr title="Australian Energy Market Operator">AEMO</abbr> holds the benefit of DSM Reserve Capacity
Security for more than one Reserve Capacity Cycle, the total amount of
the DSM Reserve Capacity Security for all of those Reserve Capacity
Cycles in aggregate is the highest amount determined under clause
4.13A.1.</p>
<p>4.13A.5. The amount determined under clause 4.13A.4 does not include
Reserve Capacity Cycles for which the Demand Side Programme does not
have any Reserve Capacity Obligations.</p>
<p>4.13A.6. The DSM Reserve Capacity Security for a Demand Side Programme
must be:</p>
<p><span class="arithmatex">\(a\)</span> an obligation in writing that:</p>
<p>i. is from a Security Provider;</p>
<p>ii. is a guarantee or bank undertaking in a form prescribed by <abbr title="Australian Energy Market Operator">AEMO</abbr>;</p>
<p>iii. is duly executed by the Security Provider and delivered
unconditionally to <abbr title="Australian Energy Market Operator">AEMO</abbr>;</p>
<p>iv. constitutes valid and binding unsubordinated obligations of the
Security Provider to pay to <abbr title="Australian Energy Market Operator">AEMO</abbr> amounts in accordance with its terms

in the circumstances to the obligation under clause 4.13A.6(a), a
Security Deposit.</p>
<p>4.13A.7. If, at any time, and for whatever reason, the amount of the DSM
Reserve Capacity Security is less than the amount determined in
accordance with clauses 4.13A.1 or 4.13A.4, as applicable, the Market
Participant must immediately:</p>
<p><span class="arithmatex">\(a\)</span> in the case of a DSM Reserve Capacity Security in the form
specified in clause 4.13A.6(a):</p>
<p>i. replace the DSM Reserve Capacity Security for the amount determined
in accordance with clauses 4.13A.1 or 4.13A.4, as applicable; or</p>
<p>ii. provide a further DSM Reserve Capacity Security for the difference
between the amount of the DSM Reserve Capacity Security and the amount
determined in accordance with clauses 4.13A.1 or 4.13A.4, as applicable,</p>
<p>and, in both cases, the DSM Reserve Capacity Security must comply with
clause 4.13A.6(a); or</p>
<p><span class="arithmatex">\(b\)</span> in the case of a Security Deposit, increase the amount of the

require, including signing any deeds or other documents, to ensure <abbr title="Australian Energy Market Operator">AEMO</abbr>

<p>4.13A.8. In respect of a Reserve Capacity Cycle, after the time and date
referred to in clause 4.1.23, a Market Participant may apply to <abbr title="Australian Energy Market Operator">AEMO</abbr> for
a recalculation of the amount of DSM Reserve Capacity Security required
to be held for a Demand Side Programme under clauses 4.13A.1 or 4.13A.4,
as applicable.</p>
<p>4.13A.9. Within ten Business Days after receipt of a request from a
Market Participant under clause 4.13A.8, <abbr title="Australian Energy Market Operator">AEMO</abbr> must recalculate the
amount of DSM Reserve Capacity Security required to be held for a Demand
Side Programme under clauses 4.13A.1 or 4.13A.4, as applicable. If the

<p>4.13A.11. Where a Market Participant’s existing DSM Reserve Capacity
Security is due to expire or cease to have effect for any reason and
after that expiration the Market Participant will continue to have an
obligation to ensure <abbr title="Australian Energy Market Operator">AEMO</abbr> holds the benefit of DSM Reserve Capacity

<p><span class="arithmatex">\(c\)</span> effective when the existing DSM Reserve Capacity Security expires
or otherwise ceases to have effect.</p>
<p>4.13A.12. Where a Market Participant’s DSM Reserve Capacity Security is
affected by any of the circumstances specified in the <abbr title="Wholesale Energy Market. The market established under section 122 of the Electricity Industry Act.">WEM</abbr> Procedure
referred to in clause 4.13A.23 that may require replacement DSM Reserve

<p><span class="arithmatex">\(a\)</span> in the form specified in clause 4.13A.6;</p>
<p><span class="arithmatex">\(b\)</span> an amount not less than the level required under clauses 4.13A.1

first becomes aware of the relevant change in circumstance (whether by

<abbr title="Australian Energy Market Operator">AEMO</abbr>).</p>
<p>4.13A.13. Where DSM Reserve Capacity Security is provided as a Security
Deposit in accordance with clause 4.13A.6(b), it will accrue interest
daily at the <abbr title="Australian Energy Market Operator">AEMO</abbr> Deposit Rate, and <abbr title="Australian Energy Market Operator">AEMO</abbr> must pay the Market Participant
the interest accumulated at the end of each calendar month less any

<th><p><strong>Explanatory Note</strong></p>
<p>Section 4.15 sets out the new Network Access Quantity
(<strong>NAQ</strong>) framework.</p>
<p>The NAQ:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>defines the network capacity, in MW, available to a Facility for
the purpose of determining the Capacity Credits that can be assigned to
the Facility up to the amount of its Certified Reserve Capacity;
and</p></li>
<li><p>establishes a preferential right to receive a Capacity Credit,
which can only be reduced in specific circumstances.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The primary purpose of the NAQ is to protect a Facility’s quantity of
Capacity Credits from an unhedgeable risk of being inefficiently
displaced by new entrant facilities connecting in constrained sections
of the network, where that additional capacity is not needed for system
reliability but is simply displacing an existing performing
resource.</p>
<p>The NAQ protects the investment in Facilities that continue to
participate in the RCM and meet all their performance obligations. A
Facility that, for reasons related to its own poor performance, fails to
provide its capacity to the RCM when required by the system surrenders
its ability to retain the unreliable portion of its NAQ. A Facility that
retires (or is mothballed or removed from service) must relinquish its
NAQ.</p>
<p>The NAQ is determined in relation to network capacity and is based on
the physical limits of the network. Hence, the NAQ serves as a cap on
the amount of Capacity Credits that can be assigned in specific regions
of the network. NAQ will be determined for a Facility up to the amount
of network capacity that can accommodate the Facility’s Certified
Reserve Capacity at peak times or other periods of low reserve. This
will ensure that the sum of NAQ determined for Facilities in specific
network regions (and in aggregate for the network as a whole) does not
exceed the transfer capability of the network.</p>
<p>Once NAQ is determined, new Facilities seeking to connect in a
specific region of the network can only receive NAQ up to the residual
capacity of the network in that region, after accounting for NAQ that
has already been determined.</p>
<p>A Facility’s NAQ can be reduced or increased due to ‘organic’ changes
that are beyond the control of the Facility i.e. due to changes in
demand, network configuration, or weather conditions for intermittent
facilities. The policy position is to afford these facilities a priority
for additional NAQ should conditions improve (ahead of other capacity).
This is intended to be implemented in the new framework by tracking a
‘Highest Network Access Quantity’ value.</p>
<p>The NAQ has no role in dispatch or settlement of the energy or ESS
markets, which will operate under the new Security Constrained Economic
Dispatch market model.</p>
<p>In accordance with the Miscellaneous Amendments No. 2, section 4.15
will be amended to '[Blank'] for the period from 1 March 2022 until the
amendments contained in the Tranches 2 and 3 Amendments (i.e. those set
out below) below commence on 1 September 2022.</p></th>

<th><p><strong>Explanatory Note</strong></p>
<p>Clause 4.15.1 requires AEMO to determine NAQs for relevant
Facilities.</p>
<p>A Facility’s NAQ is a function of:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>the Facility’s Certified Reserve Capacity; and</p></li>
<li><p>the network capacity that is available to accommodate the
Facility’s Certified Reserve Capacity.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Therefore, once AEMO has verified the performance capability of the
Facility (through the process of assigning Certified Reserve Capacity)
AEMO will then conduct an assessment (through a network capacity
modelling exercise) to determine how much of the Facility’s certified
output can be accommodated by the network.</p>
<p>Clause 4.15.5 will be replaced by the <em>Wholesale Electricity
Market Amendment (Tranche 5 Amendments) Rules 2021</em> (<strong>Tranche
5 Amendments</strong>) on 1 September 2022.</p>
<p>Tranche 6 Exposure Draft 1 included proposed amendments to ensure
that the facility dispatch scenarios developed by AEMO for use with the
Network Access Quantity Model consider Facilities with Early Certified
Reserve Capacity.</p>
<p>An additional issue with this clause was identified by AEMO after the
publication of Tranche 6 Exposure Draft 1. Depending on the relevant
Step in Appendix 3, a Facilities may be dispatched up to their Certified
Reserve Capacity or their Network Access Quantity assigned in the
previous Reserve Capacity Cycle. In the situation where either the total
assigned Certified Reserve Capacity or Network Access Quantities is less
than the peak demand it will be impossible for AEMO to satisfy clause
4.15.5(c).</p>
<p>For this reason, clause 4.15.5 is further amended to remove clause
4.15.5(c). How AEMO will create facility dispatch scenarios in a
shortfall situation will be covered in the Network Access Quantity WEM
Procedure.</p>
<p>Finally, following the consultation period for Tranche 6 Exposure
Draft 2, AEMO made a further suggestion to remove the requirement to
model NCESS for the creation of facility dispatch scenarios. AEMO
suggested to create Constraint Equations to ensure that during a solve,
the Facilities redispatch always meet the NCESS requirement. AEMO
considers that modelling the NCESS in the facility dispatch scenarios
may have an adverse impact that could result in overallocation of
Network Access Quantities to an NCESS Facility. In addition, the
solution using Constraint Equations is easier to implement and
consistent with the current design of the NAQ model.</p>
<p>In making its recommendation, AEMO (in consultation with Western
Power) considered whether it would be feasible to translate all possible
types of NCESS into Constraint Equations, considering the type of
constraint could be very different compared to Network thermal
constraints. AEMO and Western Power identified two scenarios where it
would not be possible to use a Constraint Equation to enforce an
NCESS:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>if the NCESS influences the dispatch of a Non Scheduled Facility
- note the NSF have a set dispatch value equal to their traded Certified
Reserve Capacity at any time, consistent with clause 4.15.9(d) that
requires AEMO to treat them as unconstrained; and</p></li>
<li><p>if the NCESS translates into a non-linear equation.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Both Western Power and AEMO do not foresee either of these scenarios
happening in the near future. In the event of an NCESS requiring either
the constraint of a NSF or to use a non-linear equation, AEMO would be
able to make modifications required to the NAQ model to account for it.
However, anticipating the design for this unlikely edge case would
require non-negligible effort and time and AEMO does not think this is
appropriate at this stage.</p></th>

obligations and therefore section 4.25 does not apply.</p>
<p>Clauses 4.25.3A and 4.25.9 are also amended by the Amending Rules
contained in the Rule Change Panel's Final Report for Rule Change
Proposal RC_2014_03 (Administrative Improvements to the Outage Process).
However, as this companion version of the WEM Rules only shows the
Tranches 2 and 3 Amendments as those amending rules (made by the
Minister at the date this companion version was prepared) will be
commenced last, please refer to the Final Report for Rule Change
Proposal RC_2014_03 (Administrative Improvements to the Outage Process)

<p>In the new WEM, Market Participants must offer adequate capacity into
the Real-Time Market to cover the RCOQ for their Registered Facilities.
Clause 4.26.1G requires AEMO to calculate Real‑Time Market Offer
Shortfall quantities for each Trading Interval for each Scheduled
Facility or Semi-Scheduled Facility in Commercial Operation. The
calculation converts the Dispatch Interval shortfall quantities
calculated for a Facility under clause 4.26.1H to a Trading Interval
quantity, which is then capped to ensure that total refund quantities do
not exceed the Facility’s RCOQ.</p>
<p>Industry feedback expressed the view that including real-time offer
shortfall calculations was not required as the requirement to lodge a
Forced Outage was still in place. It is correct that if a Forced Outage
is lodged no refund would apply under this calculation, but including
consideration of offer shortfalls means the shortfall will immediately
be reflected in settlement regardless of the timing or action of the
outage.</p></th>

<p>Section 4.28C enables Market Participants with new facilities that
require a long lead time to apply to AEMO for early certification of
Reserve Capacity. Currently, an application may be made for eligible
facilities for a Capacity Year prior to 1 January of Year 1 of the
Reserve Capacity Cycle relating to that Capacity Year.</p>
<p>The ability for a Market Participant to make an application for early
certification of Reserve Capacity will continue subject to the following
key changes:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>applications may only be made up to two years before the start of
the relevant Reserve Capacity Cycle;</p></li>
<li><p>Market Participants will need to demonstrate to AEMO that the
project requires a lead time longer than the start of the Reserve
Capacity Cycle in which Capacity Credits are being sought for the
facility; and</p></li>
<li><p>eligible facilities will be assigned certified Reserve Capacity
and an Indicative NAQ. However, the number of Capacity Credits and a
Final NAQ will only be determined for the facility at the time, and in
accordance with, the standard processes and timeframes for the Reserve
Capacity Cycle in which Capacity Credits for the facility are being
sought.</p></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>For example, Capacity Credits for an application for Early Certified
Reserve Capacity that is submitted by a Market Participant in the 2021

<p>Clause 4.29.1 is amended as a consequence of the deletion of the
Reserve Capacity Auction, and to remove redundant references to previous
Reserve Capacity Cycles.</p>
<p>Clause 4.29.1 (and section 4.29) was amended pursuant to RCM Pricing
Reforms to accommodate the changes to the price to be paid for Reserve
Capacity from the 2019 Reserve Capacity Cycle. To facilitate the pricing
reforms, the clause was restructured so that clause 4.29.1 calculates
the annual Reserve Capacity Price, instead of a Facility Monthly Reserve
Capacity Price which is now calculated in accordance with clause
4.29.1A.</p>
<p>As a result of the RCM Pricing Reforms and the deletion of the
Reserve Capacity Auction, Facilities will receive the same Reserve
Capacity Price except in two situations.</p>
<p>Firstly, if the Facility is a Transitional Facility and the Reserve
Capacity Cycle is a Transitional Reserve Capacity Cycle, the Reserve
Capacity Price for the Facility will be as determined in accordance with
clause 4.29.1B. A Transitional Facility is an existing Facility (other
than a DSP) that was assigned Capacity Credits in the 2018 Reserve
Capacity Cycle. A Transitional Facility will be assigned Capacity
Credits at the Reserve Capacity Price subject to a floor of $114,000 and
a cap of $140,000. The cap and floor prices will be escalated in each of
the subsequent nine Reserve Capacity Cycles (i.e. up to and including
the 2028 Reserve Capacity Cycle) by the Reserve Bank of Australia's
Statement of Monetary Policy forecast Consumer Price Index for June of
Year 3 of the relevant Reserve Capacity Cycle in accordance with clause
4.29.1C.</p>
<p>Secondly, if the Facility is a Fixed Price Facility and the Reserve
Capacity Cycle is a Fixed Price Reserve Capacity Cycle for that Fixed
Price Facility, the Reserve Capacity Price for the Facility will be the
value determined in accordance with clause 4.29.1D. A Fixed Price
Facility is a Facility that will be assigned Capacity Credits at the
Reserve Capacity Price in the first Reserve Capacity Cycle in which it
is classified as a Fixed Price Facility. That Reserve Capacity Price
will be escalated in each of the subsequent four Reserve Capacity Cycles
by the Reserve Bank of Australia's Statement of Monetary Policy forecast
Consumer Price Index for June of Year 3 of the relevant Reserve Capacity
Cycle.</p>
<p>Upgrades of Facilities will receive the same Reserve Capacity Price
as the parent Facility unless the upgrade is a separate Facility for the
purposes of the WEM Rules. The main reason for this approach is the
absence of separate metering for the parent Facility and any associated

<p>Sections 4.30 and 4.31 are added to move capacity credit allocation
from chapter 9 (sections 9.4 and 9.5) to Chapter 4, changes in taxonomy,
change to clause references in Chapter 9. Changes also made to provide
clarity to Market Participants regarding the cut-off time.</p>
<p>The clause numbering in new sections 4.30 and 4.31 is consistent with
the numbering in sections 9.4 and 9.5.</p>
<p>Capacity Credit Allocations have changed from a monthly process which
was included in the consultation. AEMO identified implementation issues
where the monthly CCA would be effected by a transfer or reduction in
capacity credits late in the month which would have an impact on prior
trading week settlement.</p>
<p>Section 4.30 has been further amended as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The rules permit a participant to revise a CCA; however, they do
not require AEMO to check they have sufficient Capacity Credits to make
the revision. [4.30.6]. This undermines a key rule concept.</p></li>
<li><p>The rules allow participants to amend CCAs after the termination
of Capacity Credits; however, there are existing concepts that would
allow participants to do this (by withdrawing a CCA and submitting
another one). [4.30.10]. The current rule drafting for Capacity Credit
Allocation amendments adds implementation complexity for no benefit to
the market.</p></li>
<li><p>The rules put a 2 day deadline for CCA amendments to be resolved.
This was previously important, as changes to CCAs would impact a Market
Participant’s Trading Margin, and therefore is time-sensitive; however,
this is no longer the case. [4.30.10 and 4.30.11] The current rule
drafting for resolving Capacity Credit Allocation amendments within 2
days adds implementation complexity for no benefit to the
market.</p></li>
<li><p>The rules put a requirement for AEMO to amend CCAs by 5PM on the
Scheduling Day if a participant does not amend the CCAs by 5PM on the
Scheduling Day. [4.30.11] This makes it impossible for AEMO to comply
with the obligation by amending them exactly at 5PM on the Scheduling
Day.</p></li>
<li><p>The current drafting also explicitly refers to terminations
identified in clause 4.30.9. It should be written more generally to
consider any situation where the CCAs for a Facility exceed the Capacity
Credits (e.g. where a Facility is transferred, the outgoingl Facility
owner having CCAs for a Facility they no longer own).</p></li>

<p>Clauses 5.2A.2 and 5.2A.3 require a Market Participant to apply for

<th><p><strong>Explanatory Note</strong></p>
<p>Chapter 6 is to be renamed ‘The Short Term Energy Market’ and will be
limited to matters relating only to the Short Term Energy Market
(<strong>STEM</strong>).</p>
<p>The STEM is a financially binding day-ahead market. STEM provides a
centrally coordinated opportunity for Market Participants to trade
around their bilateral positions, supplementing and complementing the
off-market bilateral contracts regime. It allows for financial trading
against contract positions, rather than centralised scheduling and
commitment, though it does provide a firm financial basis for commitment
of long-start-time Registered Facilities.</p>
<p>The changes focus on four main aspects:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>removing narrow windows and timings for AEMO and Market
Participants to submit information, in favour of continuously updated
information from AEMO, and flexibility for Market Participants to submit
information at their convenience;</p></li>
<li><p>Market Participants will now use data from the Pre-Dispatch
Schedules to bound their STEM submissions, replacing the current
requirement for AEMO to calculate certain information daily for use in
the STEM;</p></li>
<li><p>adjusting the present requirement to offer in at short-run
marginal cost where the Market Participant has market power, to
explicitly allow incorporation of a risk premium where a Market
Participant is uncertain of its ability to generate, including for
projected ESS provision; and</p></li>
<li><p>removing the requirement for Market Participants to lock-in
energy to meet their Net Bilateral Position in the STEM, allowing Market
Participants to leave some of their position open until the Real-Time
Market.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>As a result of Chapter 6 being limited to matters relating only to
the STEM, further amendments are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>sections 6.1 to 6.11 (STEM) will be retained subject to
amendments in these WEM Rules to reflect the changes outlined
above;</p></li>
<li><p>sections 6.11A and 6.12 (Non-Balancing Dispatch) are deleted and
replaced by new arrangements in the Central Dispatch Process in Chapter
7;</p></li>
<li><p>sections 6.13 and 6.14 (Settlement quantities) will be retained
subject to amendments to Settlement (Chapter 9);</p></li>
<li><p>section 6.15 (TES) is deleted as part of the amendments to
Settlement (Chapter 9);</p></li>
<li><p>section 6.16 (Metered Schedule) will be retained subject to
amendments to Settlement (Chapter 9);</p></li>
<li><p>sections 6.16A, 6.16B and clauses 6.17.3 to 6.17.5C (Out of Merit
and Constrained Payments) are deleted and replaced by uplift payments
and other amendments to Settlement (Chapter 9);</p></li>
<li><p>clauses 6.17.1 and 6.17.2 (Balancing Settlement Quantities) are
retained and renamed, and adjusted for the new Real-Time Market as
reflected in Settlement (Chapter 9);</p></li>
<li><p>clauses 6.17.6 to 6.17.8 (Non-Balancing Facility dispatch
payments) are deleted pursuant to amendments to Settlement (Chapter 9)
(and changes relating to the Reserve Capacity Mechanism that are
scheduled to commence on 1 October 2021);</p></li>
<li><p>clause 6.17.9 (Settlement Tolerance) is retained and moved to
Chapter 9 pursuant to the amendments to Settlement (Chapter 9);</p></li>
<li><p>clause 6.17.10 and section 6.18 (Portfolio Settlement Tolerance)
is deleted (as the portfolio will no longer exist under the new market
arrangements) pursuant to the amendments to Settlement (Chapter
9);</p></li>
<li><p>section 6.19 (Market Advisories) is deleted and merged with
Dispatch Advisories to create new Market Advisories in section
7.11;</p></li>
<li><p>section 6.20 (Energy Price Limits) is retained subject to
amendments pursuant to the amendments in the Market Power workstream;
and</p></li>
<li><p>section 6.21 (Settlement Data) is retained subject to amendments
to Settlement (Chapter 9).</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Various clauses in Chapter 6 are also amended to reflect the Amending
Rules contained in the Rule Change Panel's Final Report for Rule Change
Proposal RC_2014_03 (Administrative Improvements to the Outage
Process).</p>
<p>However, as this companion version of the WEM Rules only shows the

<th><p><strong>Explanatory Note</strong></p>
<p>The structure of Chapter 7 reflects the integration of the operation
of the Real-Time Market and the Central Dispatch Process in accordance
with the Security Constrained Economic Dispatch (<strong>SCED</strong>)
market model.</p>
<p>More specifically:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Chapter 7 is renamed ‘Real-Time Market Operation and Dispatch’
and substantially amended; and</p></li>
<li><p>Chapters 7A and 7B are deleted.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>As the name implies, SCED determines the most economic dispatch of
individual resources across the SWIS. In the current market, AEMO
schedules energy and Essential System Services separately, and
congestion on the network is accounted for by amendments to the market
dispatch.</p>
<p>The adoption of the SCED market model, which includes consideration
of network constraints in the calculation of dispatch schedules, is
essential for the SWIS in order to maintain system security as
congestion increases. Adopting the SCED market model will require AEMO
to replace the existing market and dispatch systems that it uses to
operate the Wholesale Electricity Market.</p>
<p>Adopting a SCED market model is fundamental to realising the benefits
of the sustainable and efficient management of network constraints, and
is expected to deliver the following benefits.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>transparent determination of the least-cost dispatch outcome for
the market, accounting for generation offers and network conditions, and
allowing Market Participants to respond, resulting in increased
competition in the Real-Time Market and a downward pressure on the
energy price over time;</p></li>
<li><p>greater automation in the calculation of network constraints,
which improves network efficiency by allowing constraints to be set less
conservatively without compromising system reliability; and</p></li>
<li><p>greater automation in the dispatch process, so that system
security can be managed efficiently as the level of constraints
increases, and the generation mix continues to change.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>However, various clauses in Chapter 7 are also amended by the October
2021 RCM Pricing Amendments, including as a result of tranche based
dispatch payments for DSPs ceasing from the 2019 Reserve Capacity Cycle
(i.e. from the 2021 Capacity Year), the Tranche 1 Amendments, the
Miscellaneous Amendments No. 1 and the Amending Rules contained in the
Rule Change Panel's Final Report for Rule Change Proposal RC_2014_03
(Administrative Improvements to the Outage Process). As Chapter 7 is
deleted to reflect the amendments contained in the Tranches 2 and 3
Amendments, as those amending rules (made by the Minister at the date
this companion version was prepared) will be commenced last, please
refer to the October 2021 RCM Pricing Amendments, Tranche 1 Amendments,
Miscellaneous Amendments No. 1 and the Final Report for Rule Change

to see the changes to Chapter 7 that will either apply until the
Tranches 2 and 3 Amendments to Chapter 7 commence, or that amend
amending rules contained in the Tranches 2 and 3 Amendments.</p>
<p>Several clauses in Chapter 7 of the current WEM Rules have also been

<li><p>clauses 7.4.54 to 7.4.62 – Standing Submissions.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>An overview of the main changes affecting section 7.4 is provided
below.</p>
<p><strong>Changes to Real-Time Market Submission terminology and
processing rules</strong></p>
<p>Section 7.4 has been amended to clarify the definitions of “Real-Time
Market Submission” and “Standing Real-Time Market Submission” and the
general processing rules for these submissions. Under the proposed
changes:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>A Real-Time Market Submission relates to a Registered Facility,
Market Service and Dispatch Interval.</p></li>
<li><p>A Market Participant may include multiple Real-Time Market
Submissions in a single electronic submission. AEMO will either accept
the electronic submission (and all the Real-Time Market Submissions
within it) or reject the electronic submission (and all the Real-Time
Market Submissions within it).</p></li>
<li><p>A Standing Real-Time Market Submission is a default Real-Time
Market Submission for a Registered Facility and Market Service for
Dispatch Intervals starting at specified times on Trading Days of a
specified type.</p></li>
<li><p>A Market Participant may include multiple Standing Real-Time
Market Submissions in a single electronic submission, but must ensure
that the Standing Real-Time Market Submissions in an electronic
submission for a Registered Facility and Market Service, in combination,
uniquely specify the default Real-Time Market Submission to apply for
each Dispatch Interval in a generic Trading Week.</p></li>
<li><p>At any point in time, the Real-Time Market Submission for a
Registered Facility, Market Service and Dispatch Interval is the
(variation) Real-Time Market Submission most recently accepted by AEMO
under clause 7.4.49(a)(i), or, if no such submission exists, the most
recently accepted applicable Standing Real-Time Market
Submission.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Changes to the provision and use of Injection and Withdrawal
forecasts for Semi-Scheduled Facilities and Non-Scheduled
Facilities</strong></p>
<p>Previously, a Market Participant was required to ensure that the sum
of the quantities in the Price-Quantity Pairs for Injection in its
Semi-Scheduled Facility Real-Time Market Submission was equal to the
Market Participant’s unconstrained Injection forecast for the Facility.
While this arrangement provided an Injection forecast to AEMO, it could
also restrict the level to which the Facility could be dispatched,
because of the absence of Price-Quantity Pairs covering Injection levels
above the Market Participant’s forecast. Additionally, the arrangement
did not support the provision of Withdrawal forecasts.</p>
<p>Under the proposed new arrangements, the quantities in the
Price-Quantity Pairs for energy for a Semi-Scheduled Facility or
Non-Scheduled Facility should sum to the maximum quantity that the
Market Participant considers the Facility could Inject/Withdraw assuming
it was not constrained by AEMO (including on price), i.e. assuming no
shortage of any intermittent fuel such as wind. The Market Participant
will also include an Unconstrained Injection Forecast and Unconstrained
Withdrawal Forecast, defined as follows, in each Real-Time Market
Submission:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Unconstrained Injection Forecast</strong>: The expected
MW level of Injection at the end of a Dispatch Interval for a
Semi-Scheduled Facility or Non-Scheduled Facility, assuming that the
Facility will not be subject to a Dispatch Instruction or direction from
AEMO that limits its Injection, and allowing for expected conditions,
commitment and control intentions and the effect of any Outages that
have not been rejected for the Facility.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Unconstrained Withdrawal Forecast</strong>: The expected
MW level of Withdrawal at the end of a Dispatch Interval for a
Semi-Scheduled Facility or Non-Scheduled Facility, assuming that the
Facility will not be subject to a Dispatch Instruction or direction from
AEMO that limits its Withdrawal, and allowing for expected conditions,
commitment and control intentions and the effect of any Outages that
have not been rejected for the Facility</p></li>
</ul>
<p>AEMO may use the Unconstrained Injection Forecasts and Unconstrained
Withdrawal Forecasts provided in Real-Time Market Submissions as inputs
to the Dispatch Algorithm, but may also use alternative forecasts if it
reasonably considers they are likely to be more accurate.</p>
<p>Price-Quantity Pairs will continue to be used within the Dispatch
Algorithm to determine Dispatch Caps for Semi-Scheduled Facilities.
However, Semi-Scheduled Facilities will not be constrained where their
Unconstrained Injection Forecasts or Unconstrained Withdrawal Forecasts
are lower than the cleared Price-Quantity Pairs.</p>
<p><strong>Changes to Real-Time Market Submission obligations for
Non-Scheduled Facilities</strong>:</p>
<p>It is important for AEMO to have visibility of a Non-Scheduled
Facility’s intentions to support the production of forward-looking
Market Schedules and provide overall transparency to the market. For
this reason, Market Participants will be required to submit Real-Time
Market Submissions for their Non-Scheduled Facilities.</p>
<p>The submission requirements for Non-Scheduled Facilities have been
separated from the requirements for the Registered Facilities being
actively dispatched by AEMO through the Dispatch Algorithm (Scheduled
Facilities, Semi-Scheduled Facilities and Interruptible Loads). The
Market Participant must declare its intentions (either Injection or
Withdrawal) by including a single Price-Quantity Pair at the price
cap/floor. The Market Participant will also provide an Unconstrained
Injection Forecast and Unconstrained Withdrawal Forecast for each
Dispatch Interval.</p>
<p>These inputs will be used in the Dispatch Algorithm to account for
the expected impact of Non‑Scheduled Facilities, and will be included in
the publication requirements to support transparency.</p>
<p>While Market Participants will be required to make Real-Time Market
Submissions for Non-Scheduled Facilities, they will have a lower
threshold for updating their submissions to reflect that they are not
actively dispatched. The obligation to maintain accurate forecast
quantities for a Non-Scheduled Facility will not attract civil
penalties, and the requirement to update forecast quantities is reduced
to when information supporting underlying expectations has significantly
changed or the Market Participant is knowingly intervening in the
operation of the Facility (e.g. has specific knowledge about Outages,
commitment or control intentions of behind-the-meter components), as
provided for under new clause 7.4.37A.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>When the Pre-Dispatch Schedule projects a shortfall in a
Frequency Control Essential System Service (FCESS), clause 7.4.5(b)
requires SESSM Award holders to update their Real-Time Market
Submissions to offer all the available accredited capacity of their
awarded Facilities as In‑Service Capacity. This could result in more
capacity being offered as In-Service Capacity than is necessary or
desirable.</p></li>
<li><p>The clause does not correctly account for a Facility that is not
subject to any Outage in a Dispatch Interval, e.g. clause 7.4.5(a) would
require the Market Participant to offer the maximum accredited quantity
of the relevant FCESS instead of the contracted quantity in this
situation.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Under the amendments, a Market Participant holding a SESSM Award
must:</p>
<ul>
<li><blockquote>
<p>under normal conditions, offer (at least) the lower of their
contracted quantity and available accredited capacity in the relevant
FCESS, as either Available or In-Service Capacity (clause 7.4.5(a));</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote>
<p>if the Reference Scenario for a Pre-Dispatch Interval projects a
shortfall in the FCESS, ensure that they are offering all their
available accredited capacity in the FCESS, as either Available or
In‑Service Capacity (clause 7.4.5(b)); and</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote>
<p>if the Reference Scenario for a Pre-Dispatch Interval or Dispatch
Interval projects that the relevant Facility will be enabled to provide
the FCESS, ensure that they are offering the relevant Essential System
Service Enablement Quantity as In-Service Capacity, as well as
sufficient In-Service energy capacity to facilitate the FCESS enablement
(clause 7.4.5(c)).</p>
</blockquote></li>
</ul>
<p>The available accredited capacity of the Facility in the relevant
FCESS is determined as:</p>

<p>the lowest Remaining Available Capacity for the FCESS under any
applicable Outage for the Facility; or</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote>
<p>if there are no applicable Outages, the maximum accredited quantity

<p>Feedback from AEMO’s implementation program identified a number of
issues with the proposal to include Demand Side Programmes in the
Dispatch Algorithm, including:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>the potential for inaccurate identification of potential Demand
Side Programme dispatch in the forward Market Schedules;</p></li>
<li><p>issues with the proposed tie-breaking approach; and</p></li>
<li><p>issues relating to the need to take into account the specific
restrictions associated with the dispatch of Demand Side Programmes,
e.g. notice periods, hours available for dispatch, maximum hours of
dispatch per year, etc).</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Due to these issues, Demand Side Programmes will not be dispatched
using the Dispatch Algorithm. Instead, an alternative approach has been
developed for the dispatch of these Facilities.</p>
<p>A key component of this approach is the requirement for Market
Participants to provide DSP Withdrawal Profile Submissions that specify
two forecast quantities for each Dispatch Interval:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>a DSP Unconstrained Withdrawal Quantity, which is the Market
Participant’s estimate of the average MW consumption of its Demand Side
Programme in the Dispatch Interval assuming that the Demand Side
Programme is not affected by any Dispatch Instruction or Reserve
Capacity Test; and</p></li>
<li><p>a DSP Constrained Withdrawal Quantity, which the DSP
Unconstrained Withdrawal Quantity adjusted to take into account the
impact of any impending dispatch or Reserve Capacity Tests about which
the Market Participant has been advised.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The two values are expected to be identical for most Dispatch
Intervals.</p>
<p>New section 7.4A sets out the obligations with respect to DSP
Withdrawal Profile Submissions. The clauses below are structured
similarly to the clauses in section 7.4 (Real-Time Market Submissions),
but are included in a separate section to reflect that these obligations
apply only to Demand Side Programmes.</p></th>

Submission in accordance with this section 7.4A for each Dispatch
Interval in the Week-Ahead Schedule Horizon for each of its Demand Side
Programmes.</p>
<p>7.4A.2. If <abbr title="Australian Energy Market Operator">AEMO</abbr> has not accepted a DSP Withdrawal Profile Submission for

<p>The intent of the priority order is to resolve tied offers by:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>ensuring Registered Facilities are able to meet Dispatch
Targets;</p></li>
<li><p>preferring Registered Facilities that would maintain consistency
with dispatch in the previous Dispatch Interval;</p></li>
<li><p>preferring DSPs over other types of Registered Facilities to
preserve flexible capacity (this is expected to only occur where there
is a shortfall – if both are offered at the price cap, we would rather
retain the flexibility of the other facility (e.g. a battery
discharging) than the inflexible DSP);</p></li>
<li><p>preferring DSPs that do not share an Associated Load with an
Interruptible Load over DSPs that do; and</p></li>
<li><p>ensuring dispatch would be shared between tied offers. For
example, if 10MW was required and the Generator A tied offer tranche is
for 20MW, Generator B tied offer tranche is for 30MW, the pro-rata
loading would be 4MW for Generator A and 6MW for Generator B.</p></li>

<p>Clause 7.6.23 is amended to reflect the removal of Demand Side
Programmes from the Dispatch Algorithm. Note that the requirement in
clause 7.6.23(d) has been relocated to clause 7.6.5B(b)(iii).</p>
<p>Clause 7.6.23 has been further amended to remove clause 7.6.23(b).
AEMO has advised that this requirement adds complexity to the tie-break
mechanism and would increase project costs. AEMO has built the tie-break

<p>Clauses 7.11C.6 to 7.11C.11 set out a regime that is intended to
ensure that Market Clearing Prices are not depressed by reason of AEMO’s
manual intervention. For example, if AEMO directs a Registered Facility

the next unit of energy will be lower than it otherwise would have been
(i.e. because that cheaper generation is now available to provide the
marginal unit of energy).</p>
<p>This is a structural effect that is not dealt with by the uplift

<p>Section 7.13A enables AEMO to determine the Not-In-Service Capacity
for each Registered Facility that is assigned Capacity Credits. Market
Participants for Facilities that are assigned Capacity Credits are
required to present the Facility's capacity at least up to its Reserve
Capacity Obligation Quantity in their market submissions as ‘available’
or ‘in-service’. If a price/quantity offer is “in merit” for a Trading
Interval, or directed to be in service by AEMO, the relevant Market
Participant must, subject to applicable start up timeframes, amend the
availability declaration to ‘in service’. When this is not the case, the
Not-In-Service capacity will be subject to capacity refunds.</p>

<p>Clauses 9.1.2(g)(ii) and 9.13.1 are also amended by the Governance
Amendments that commence on 1 July 2021 to introduce "Coordinator Fees"
and "Coordinator Fee rate", as applicable. However, as Chapter 9 is
deleted and replaced by the Tranches 2 and 3 Amendments, Chapter 9 only
shows the Tranches 2 and 3 Amendments as they are the amending rules
affecting this section (made by the Minister at the date this companion

Governance Amendments to see the changes to Clauses 9.1.2(g)(ii) and
9.13.1 that will commence on 1 July 2021.</p>
<p>Various clauses in Chapter 9 are also amended by the October 2021 RCM
Pricing Amendments, including as a result of tranche based dispatch
payments for DSPs ceasing from the 2019 Reserve Capacity Cycle (i.e.
from the 2021 Capacity Year), the Tranche 1 Amendments and the

<p>9.15. Adjustment Process</p>
<p>9.15.1. When undertaking an Adjustment Process <abbr title="Australian Energy Market Operator">AEMO</abbr> must:</p>
<p><span class="arithmatex">\(a\)</span> recalculate the amounts included in the Relevant Settlement
Statements in accordance with this Chapter 9 but taking into account
any:</p>
<p>i. revised meter data which has been provided by Metering Data Agents;</p>
<p>ii. actions arising from a Notice of Disagreement;</p>
<p>iii. resolution of a Notice of Dispute;</p>
<p>iv. revised Market Participant Market Fee rate or Market Participant
Regulator Fee rate;</p>
<p>v. adjustment required for GST purposes under clause 9.1.3;</p>
<p>vi. revised value that <abbr title="Australian Energy Market Operator">AEMO</abbr> reasonably considers to be in compliance
with these <abbr title="Wholesale Energy Market. The market established under section 122 of the Electricity Industry Act.">WEM</abbr> Rules and accurate; and</p>
<p>vii. other relevant value that has been revised in accordance with the
<abbr title="Wholesale Energy Market. The market established under section 122 of the Electricity Industry Act.">WEM</abbr> Rules; and</p>
<p><span class="arithmatex">\(b\)</span> provide adjusted Settlement Statements to <abbr title="Any person registered as a Rule Participant in accordance with Chapter 2 and AEMO.">Rule Participants</abbr> for
Relevant Settlement Statements on the Relevant Settlement Adjustment
Date.</p>
<p>9.15.2. Where <abbr title="Australian Energy Market Operator">AEMO</abbr> decides that it will use a revised value, as
contemplated under clause 9.15.1(a)(vi), in the final adjusted
Settlement Statement (to be issued on Settlement Adjustment Date 3 for a
Trading Week), <abbr title="Australian Energy Market Operator">AEMO</abbr> must, as soon as practicable, notify the relevant
<abbr title="Any person registered as a Rule Participant in accordance with Chapter 2 and AEMO.">Rule Participant</abbr> of the proposed revised value and the reason for its
decision.</p>
<p>9.15.3. Subject to clause 9.15.4, an adjusted Settlement Statement must
be in the same form as the original Settlement Statement, but where data
is modified between the issuance of the original Settlement Statement
and the adjusted Settlement Statement, <abbr title="Australian Energy Market Operator">AEMO</abbr> must record adjusted
settlement values in the adjusted Settlement Statement and provide an
explanation of any changes on request.</p>
<p>9.15.4. An adjusted Settlement Statement must include details of the
adjustment to be paid by or to the <abbr title="Any person registered as a Rule Participant in accordance with Chapter 2 and AEMO.">Rule Participant</abbr>, being:</p>
<p><span class="arithmatex">\(a\)</span> the adjustment which will need to be paid by or to the Rule
Participant to put the <abbr title="Any person registered as a Rule Participant in accordance with Chapter 2 and AEMO.">Rule Participant</abbr> in the position it would have
been in at the time payment was made in respect of the original
Settlement Statement if the adjusted Settlement Statement had been
issued as the original Settlement Statement (but taking into account any
adjustments previously made under this section 9.15); plus</p>
<p><span class="arithmatex">\(b\)</span> interest on the amount referred to in clause 9.15.4(a) calculated
in accordance with clause 9.1.4.</p>
<p>9.15.5. In recalculating amounts as part of an Adjustment Process, <abbr title="Australian Energy Market Operator">AEMO</abbr>
may use the version of the settlement calculation software current at
the time of the recalculation.</p>
<p>9.15.6. At the same time as <abbr title="Australian Energy Market Operator">AEMO</abbr> provides a <abbr title="Any person registered as a Rule Participant in accordance with Chapter 2 and AEMO.">Rule Participant</abbr> with an
adjusted Settlement Statement under clause 9.15.1(b), it must also
provide that <abbr title="Any person registered as a Rule Participant in accordance with Chapter 2 and AEMO.">Rule Participant</abbr> with an Invoice reflecting the adjusted
Settlement Statement and the amounts referred to in clause 9.15.4.</p>
<p>9.15.7. The Settlement Date for a Settlement Statement issued under
clause 9.15.1(b) is the date upon which transactions covered by that
Settlement Statement are settled and must be no later than the second
Business Day following the date of issue of the Invoice described in
clause 9.15.6.</p>
<p>9.15.8. If, for an Adjustment Process, the Service Fee Settlement Amount
payable to <abbr title="Australian Energy Market Operator">AEMO</abbr> under clause 9.13.2 based on the adjusted Market
Participant Market Fees settlement amount is less than the Service Fee
Settlement Amount payable to <abbr title="Australian Energy Market Operator">AEMO</abbr> under clause 9.13.2 for the last
Settlement Statement for that period, <abbr title="Australian Energy Market Operator">AEMO</abbr> must make available the
shortfall amount from the fund established under clause 9.18.9 for the
purpose of meeting <abbr title="Australian Energy Market Operator">AEMO</abbr>’s obligations under clause 9.18.8.</p>
<p>9.15.9. <abbr title="Australian Energy Market Operator">AEMO</abbr> and the <abbr title="The body established under section 4(1) of the Economic Regulation Authority Act (WA).">Economic Regulation Authority</abbr> must agree and
implement an arrangement to apply for any Adjustment Process where the
Service Fee Settlement Amount payable to the Economic Regulation

Regulator Fees settlement amount is less than the Service Fee Settlement
Amount payable to the <abbr title="The body established under section 4(1) of the Economic Regulation Authority Act (WA).">Economic Regulation Authority</abbr> under clause 9.13.3

Settlement Amount payable to the Coordinator under clause 9.13.4 based
on the adjusted Market Participant Coordinator Fees settlement amount is
less than the Service Fee Settlement Amount payable to the Coordinator
under clause 9.13.4 for the last Settlement Statement for that period.

<p>9.20.4. <abbr title="Australian Energy Market Operator">AEMO</abbr> must apply the Total Amount as follows.</p>
<p><span class="arithmatex">\(a\)</span> First, <abbr title="Australian Energy Market Operator">AEMO</abbr> must apply the Total Amount to satisfy:</p>
<p>i. payment of Service Fee Settlement Amounts to <abbr title="Australian Energy Market Operator">AEMO</abbr>, the Economic
Regulation Authority and the Coordinator (including as contemplated by
clause 9.18.10); and</p>
<p>ii. payments which <abbr title="Australian Energy Market Operator">AEMO</abbr> is required to make under Supplementary
Capacity Contracts or to a provider of a System Restart Contract with
<abbr title="Australian Energy Market Operator">AEMO</abbr>, up to a maximum for any party of the net amount which, if
sufficient funds were available, would be payable to that party,</p>
<p>but if the Total Amount is not sufficient to satisfy all of these
payments then <abbr title="Australian Energy Market Operator">AEMO</abbr> must reduce the payments proportionally. Each payment
will be based on the proportion that the Total Amount bears to the
amount that would have been required to make all payments.</p>
<p><span class="arithmatex">\(b\)</span> Second, <abbr title="Australian Energy Market Operator">AEMO</abbr> must apply the remainder to pay the net amounts
(after the application of clause 9.20.4(a)) which, if sufficient funds
were available, it would owe to <abbr title="Any person registered as a Rule Participant in accordance with Chapter 2 and AEMO.">Rule Participants</abbr> in accordance with
clause 9.18, where those amounts are reduced by applying the following
formula:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>AAP = (NAP / TNAP) × MAA</p>
<p>where:</p>
</blockquote>
<p>i. AAP is the reduced amount actually payable by <abbr title="Australian Energy Market Operator">AEMO</abbr> to a Rule
Participant in respect of the relevant Trading Week;</p>
<p>ii. NAP is the net amount that would have been payable by <abbr title="Australian Energy Market Operator">AEMO</abbr> to the
<abbr title="Any person registered as a Rule Participant in accordance with Chapter 2 and AEMO.">Rule Participant</abbr> (after the application of clause 9.20.4(a)) but for the

Participants (after the application of clause 9.20.4(a)) but for the
application of this clause 9.20.4(b), in respect of the relevant Trading

<p>iv. MAA is the remainder of the Total Amount available for payment by
<abbr title="Australian Energy Market Operator">AEMO</abbr> after the application of clause 9.20.4(a).</p>
<p>9.20.5. If <abbr title="Australian Energy Market Operator">AEMO</abbr> has reduced any payment under clause 9.20.4 as a result
of a Payment Default and, within five Business Days of the Payment
Default, it has received full or partial payment of the overdue amount,
then <abbr title="Australian Energy Market Operator">AEMO</abbr> must within one Business Day apply the amount received
(including any interest paid under clause 9.18.7 in respect of the
Payment Default) as follows.</p>
<p><span class="arithmatex">\(a\)</span> First, <abbr title="Australian Energy Market Operator">AEMO</abbr> must apply the amount received to pay parties who
suffered a reduction under clause 9.20.4(a). The amount payable by <abbr title="Australian Energy Market Operator">AEMO</abbr>

originally reduced under clause 9.20.4(a), adjusted to reflect interest
accrued in accordance with clause 9.1.3 and any payments already made
under this clause 9.20.5. However, if the amount received by <abbr title="Australian Energy Market Operator">AEMO</abbr> is
less than the total amount payable to these parties then <abbr title="Australian Energy Market Operator">AEMO</abbr> must
reduce the payments proportionally. Each payment will be based on the
proportion that the amount received by <abbr title="Australian Energy Market Operator">AEMO</abbr> bears to the total amount
payable under this clause 9.20.5(a).</p>
<p><span class="arithmatex">\(b\)</span> Second, <abbr title="Australian Energy Market Operator">AEMO</abbr> must apply the remainder on a pro-rata basis to all
<abbr title="Any person registered as a Rule Participant in accordance with Chapter 2 and AEMO.">Rule Participants</abbr> who suffered a reduction under clause 9.20.4(b). The
amount to be paid to each relevant <abbr title="Any person registered as a Rule Participant in accordance with Chapter 2 and AEMO.">Rule Participant</abbr> is determined by

<p>i. AAP referred to the amount to be paid to each relevant Rule
Participant;</p>
<p>ii. MAA referred to the remainder of the full or partial payment after
the application of clause 9.20.5(a); and</p>
<p>iii. NAP and TNAP have the same values as when the reduction was
calculated.</p>
<p>9.20.6. If, five Business Days after a Payment Default, <abbr title="Australian Energy Market Operator">AEMO</abbr> is yet to
recover in full the overdue amount, then it must raise a Default Levy
from all Market Participants (other than from Market Participants with
unrecovered Payment Defaults) to cover the remaining shortfall
(including interest calculated in accordance with clause 9.18.7). <abbr title="Australian Energy Market Operator">AEMO</abbr>
will determine the amount to be paid by each Market Participant, having
regard to the absolute value of the MWh of generation or consumption,
determined in accordance with the Metered Schedules, for each Market
Participant for Trading Intervals during the most recent Trading Week
for which Settlement Statements have been issued, as a proportion of the
total of those values for all Market Participants (other than Market
Participants with unrecovered Payment Defaults).</p>
<p>9.20.7. <abbr title="Australian Energy Market Operator">AEMO</abbr> must notify each relevant Market Participant of the amount
it must pay in respect of the Default Levy as determined in accordance
with clause 9.20.6 within six Business Days of the Payment Default
occurring.</p>

it disputes the amount notified.</p>
<p>9.20.9. By 2:00 PM on the eighth Business Day following the date of a

amounts received under clause 9.20.8 as follows.</p>
<p><span class="arithmatex">\(a\)</span> First, <abbr title="Australian Energy Market Operator">AEMO</abbr> must apply the total amount received to pay parties
who suffered a reduction under clause 9.20.4(a). The amount payable by

<p>Under the revised Market Information framework, neither AEMO nor the
Coordinator will be required to create and maintain a list outlining the
confidentiality status of each type of Market Information. Rather, the
WEM Rules will contain a list of principles that will guide the
classification of Market Information (that is, information required to
be produced, collected or exchanged under the WEM Rules or WEM
Procedures). The WEM Rules will continue to set out which type of
information must be published, and in limited circumstances may specify
that information is public or confidential.</p>
<p>There will only be two categories of Market Information, Public
Information and Confidential Information, and the classes under clause
10.2.2 are reduced to reflect this. Instead section 10.4 sets out how
Confidential Information may be disclosed.</p>
<p>It will be the responsibility of the Information Manager (in the
first instance) to determine the status of information. The Information
Manager can only be the Coordinator, the ERA, AEMO or a Network
Operator, and within this framework will either be the party that
collects or the party that produces the Market Information. That party
to whom the Market Information relates (known as the Information
Stakeholder) will be able to provide their view to the Information
Manager to inform the assessment of confidentiality, however it will be
solely up to the Information Manager to make this decision</p>
<p>The Coordinator will be available to resolve any disputes about
confidentiality or to provide advice to the Information Manager if
requested. The WEM Rules will allow for the Coordinator to publish a
procedure with information about assessing confidentiality, as this may
be desirable to improve transparency and consistency in decision making
across different Information Managers.</p>
<p>The intent of the drafting is that the same ‘type’ of information,
(i.e. information submitted under a certain section, clause or
sub-clause of the WEM Rules) maintains the same confidentiality status
over time. It seeks to avoid a type of Market Information being treated
as Confidential Information as it relates to one Rule Participant, but
Public Information as it relates to another Rule Participant, or
differently over time.</p></th>

<p>The intent is that the Information Manager is the party that Market
Information is delivered to in the first instance. It is expected that
in the majority of cases that this will be AEMO but that in any case it
can only be AEMO, a Network Operator, the Coordinator or the ERA – i.e.
a Market Participant cannot be an Information Manager.</p>
<p>Given that Market Information is not always delivered to a party
(i.e. sometimes AEMO or Western Power may produce their own Market
Information), clause 10.2.12 sets out a hierarchy to guide Rule
Participants and other interested parties on who the Information Manager
for a particular type of Market Information is (as there cannot be two
Information Managers for one type of Market Information). Given that
circumstances may arise where it is unclear which party should take

make a determination on who the Information Manager is.</p></th>

<p>New definition for ‘Not In-Service Capacity’ is used in clause

<p>Currently a Market Participant must submit in its Balancing
Submissions prices and quantities at which it is willing to dispatch its
Facilities. If plant is unavailable this must be declared and be
accompanied by either a planned or forced outage declaration. As a
result there will be direct financial consequences for the Market
Participant in the RCM. All plant which is declared “available” would be
subject to receiving a dispatch instruction if it is in merit. Again,
there will be consequences for the Market Participant if it is unable to
respond to a Dispatch Instruction.</p>
<p>However, under the new changes to the availability declarations, a
declaration “Available but not in service” could allow a Market
Participant to avoid being dispatched while still declaring it is
available in its real time market submissions. Even if it is in merit it
will not be issued a dispatch instructions unless it changes its status
to in service.</p>

<p>The definition of Small Aggregation as a Facility Technology Type
will be reviewed holistically with both the policy intent for facility
aggregation (at both transmission and distribution level) as well as how
DER is to participate in the WEM in the future. However, for the
purposes of the RCM, the definition of Small Aggregation as set out
below suffices to enable distributed energy resources to aggregate
behind the same TNI and participate in the RCM. These small aggregations
are expected to be registered as Non-Scheduled Facilities.</p>
<p>The definition of System Size considers contracted access to the
market which estimates the impact of a facility on the market. This
definition also explicitly references the charge and discharge
capability of Electric Storage Resources and this avoids the need to
specify single cycle changes. System Size is used in sections 2.28 and
2.29 of the Tranches 2 and 3 Amendments in the context of energy
producing systems at unregistered facilities and therefore the
definition has changed Facility to facility to account for both
registered and unregistered facilities. The definition of System Size
uses the term energy producing equipment instead of energy producing
system to denote the fact that the system comprises the entirety of all
generating and storage equipment at the facility.</p></th>

<th><p><strong>Explanatory Note</strong></p>
<p>This runway calculation does not include Intermittent Loads.
Intermittent Loads will be added to the runway calculation in a future
tranche of Amending Rules once the registration framework is
finalised.</p>
<p>1.1 This Appendix 2A sets out the steps that are to be followed by
AEMO in determining <em>TotalRunwayShare(p,DI)</em>, being the
allocation share of Market Participant p in Dispatch Interval DI for the
costs of procuring:</p>
<p>(a) Contingency Reserve Raise (see clause 9.10.30); and</p>
<p>(b) Additional RoCoF Control Requirement component of RoCoF Control
Service (see clause 9.10.34)</p>
<p>by use of a "modified runway allocation method" for each Dispatch
Interval allocating the share of the costs above to Market Participants
based on their Facility Risk (see Glossary) in the Dispatch
Interval.</p>
<p>1.2 The cost of procuring Contingency Reserve Raise and Additional
RoCoF Control Requirement component of RoCoF Control Service (jointly
referred to as the relevant Essential System Service) is allocated to
Registered Facilities with a Facility Risk greater than 10MW (see Clause
2.3 of this Appendix 2A).</p>
<p>1.3 The cost of procuring the relevant Essential System Service is
split into two components (see clause 5.1 of this Appendix 2A):</p>
<p>(a) A Network Component - this is calculated in clause 5.1(a) of this
Appendix 2A:</p>
<p>(i) This component is zero if the Largest Credible Supply Contingency
is not set by a Network Contingency. It is also zero if the Largest
Network Risk equals the Largest Facility Risk (i.e. a Facility
Contingency and Network Contingency are tied as the Largest Credible
Supply Contingency).</p>
<p>(ii) This component is non-zero if the Largest Credible Supply
Contingency is set by a Network Contingency and is not set by a Facility
Contingency as the Largest Credible Supply Contingency. In this case,
the share Network Component is calculated as the ratio of</p>
<p>(A) the difference between the Largest Network Risk and the Largest
Facility Risk; and</p>
<p>(B) the Largest Network Risk.</p>
<p>(iii) This ensures that causers of Network Contingencies only
pay:</p>
<p>(A) when their Network Contingency sets the Contingency Reserve Raise
Requirement;</p>
<p>(B) a delta - in that their cost allocation is based on the
additional relevant Essential System Service procured as a result of
their Network Contingency setting the Contingency Reserve Raise
Requirement.</p>
<p><em>For example, if Largest Network Risk = 300 (set by region A) and
Largest Facility Risk = 240 (set by generator X), then the causers of
the Region A Network Contingency would pay (300-240)/300 = 20% of the
relevant Essential System Service costs in a given Dispatch
Interval.</em></p>
<p>(iv) If two or more Network Contingencies set the Largest Credible
Supply contingency, then each tied Network Contingency is allocated an
equal share of the Network Component.</p>
<p><em>For example, if two Network Contingencies were tied with Largest
Network Risk = 300 (set by region A and region B) in the example above,
then the causers of the each Network Contingency would pay 20%/2 = 10%
of the relevant Essential System Service costs in a given Dispatch
Interval.</em></p>
<p>(b) A Facility Component (see clause 5.1(b) of this Appendix 2A)
which equals one minus the Network Component calculated above. This
component equals 100% if a Facility Contingency sets the Largest
Credible Supply Contingency.</p>
<p>1.4 Appendix 2A calculates runway shares for Registered Facilities
separately for:</p>
<p>(a) Facilities deemed to be causers of Facility Contingencies (see
Section 3 of this Appendix 2A: Applicable Facility Shares, and clause
3.3 of this Appendix 2A, which calculates the runway shares)</p>
<p>(b) Facilities deemed to be causers of Network Contingencies (see
Section 4 of this Appendix A: Network Contingency Shares, and clause 4.5
of this Appendix 2A, which calculates the runway shares)</p>
<p>Runway shares are calculated by ranking each Facility’s Facility Risk
value, and allocating them a share based on their rank (similar to the
calculation in Appendix 2 of the current WEM Rules).</p>
<p>1.5 Once the runway shares above have been calculated, participant
cost shares (<em>TotalRunwayShare(p,DI)</em>) are calculated in clause
5.3 of this Appendix 2A by taking into account:</p>
<p>(a) The Facility Component and Network Component ratios calculated in
clause 5.1 of this Appendix 2A</p>
<p>(b) The number of Network Contingencies tied as the Largest Credible
Supply Contingency (if any) in clause 5.2 of this Appendix 2A</p>
<p>(c) The facility runway shares and the network runway shares
calculated in clauses 3.3 and 4.5 of this Appendix 2A respectively.</p>
<p>Appendix 2A is also amended to include unregistered Energy Producing
Systems serving Intermittent Loads. If the Market Participant
responsible for the Non-Dispatchable Load portion of a Facility
containing an Intermittent Load is different from the Market Participant
responsible for the Registered Facility component, the runway share will
be allocated to:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>the Registered Facility when total facility export is greater
than the output of any one behind the meter unit; or</p></li>
<li><p>the Non-Dispatchable Load when the output of any one behind the
meter unit is greater than total Facility export.</p></li>

<p>1.1 The Minimum RoCoF Control Requirement component of the RoCoF
Control Service costs (abbreviated to RoCoF cost in this section) in a

shares:</p>
<p>(a) <em>Network Causer group</em>: Network Operators (this group has
one member only);</p>
<p>(b) <em>Injection Causer group</em>: Registered Facilities with
generation systems or storage systems (i.e. energy producing systems);
and</p>
<p>(c) <em>Offtake Causer group</em>: Non-Dispatchable Loads and
Registered Facilities comprising only Scheduled Loads (end-users).</p>
<p>1.2 Members of each group can exempt themselves by indicating to AEMO
that the RoCoF Ridethrough Capability of their facilities are greater
than or equal to the RoCoF Safe Limit.</p>
<p>1.3 The RoCoF costs will be allocated to those causers who cannot
exempt themselves.</p>
<p>1.4 If all facilities in a causer set are exempt then the RoCoF cost
is allocated equally to the remaining sets. This is represented by the
parameter (1/n(t)) in clause 2.4 in this Appendix 2B.</p>
<p>1.5 A Registered Facility which is able to inject (i.e. generate
energy) is only included in the Injection Causer group if it does not
have an exemption and has a non-zero metered schedule in the given

based on their share of Injection/Withdrawal during the Trading

<p>Note that a battery is deemed an Injection Causer and not an Offtake

<p>A given facility can only be a member of one Causer Group. That is,
facilities would not change between causer groups depending on whether
they are injecting or consuming. Causer Group membership is determined

characteristics, etc.) as opposed to whether the facility is generating
or consuming.</p>
<p>A clause X will be inserted (likely in standing data) dealing with
RoCoF exemption by the registration or transition rules workstream at a

Intervals. For example:</p></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><blockquote>
<p>Facility X has been accredited for 25MW of Contingency Reserve Raise
(with no SESSM triggered). A SESSM is triggered and Facility X has now
been awarded an Availability Quantity of 15 MW in all Dispatch Intervals
(under award a). The Base ESS Quantity or Base Quantity(a, DI) =
25MW.</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote>
<p>Facility Y is a new Facility, and is applying under a SESSM to
provide FCESS. Y is awarded an Availability Quantity of 10MW in all
Dispatch Intervals, under award a1. The Base Quantity(a, DI) = 0 MW for
all Dispatch Intervals (because it was not accredited previously). At a
later stage, it undergoes an upgrade, and under SESSM Award a2, it is
awarded an additional Availability Quantity (over and above a1) of 5MW
in all Dispatch Intervals. Base Quantity(a2,DI) = 10 MW, which is the
maximum that Y was accredited for under award a1 (at the time they were
awarded a2).</p>
</blockquote></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><p>The AvailabilityQuantity(a,DI) or Availability Quantity, denotes
the MW or MWs quantity of the ESS the Facility must offer in addition to
the Base ESS Quantity in a given Dispatch in at least
MinAvailability(a)% (see below) of the time during the SESSM Service
Timing. The Availability Quantity can be different in different Dispatch
Intervals. The Market Participant must offer the sum of the relevant
Availability Quantity and Base ESS Quantity (for a given SESSM Award
a):</p></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><blockquote>
<p>In the example above, Facility X, must offer 25MW (Base ESS Quantity)

<ul>
<li><blockquote>
<p>In the second example, above:</p>
</blockquote>
<p> Under award a1, Y must provide offer 0MW (Base ESS Quantity) + 10MW
(Availability Quantity) = 10 MW in all Dispatch Intervals.</p>
<p> Under award a2, Y must provide offer 10MW (Base ESS Quantity) + 5MW
(Availability Quantity) = 15 MW in all Dispatch Intervals</p></li>

<ul>
<li><p>The AvailabilityPayment(a,DI) or Per-Dispatch Interval
Availability Payment, is the price per Dispatch Interval that the Market
Participant will be paid for offering the Availability Quantity in a

where the Availability Quantity is zero, and is a flat $/Dispatch
Interval figure in Dispatch Intervals where Availability Quantity is
non-zero.</p></li>

<p>Appendix 3 is amended to:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>remove the Reserve Capacity Auction; and</p></li>
<li><p>prescribe the prioritisation order for determining Network Access
Quantities (<strong>NAQ</strong>) for Facilities for a Reserve Capacity
Cycle (<strong>RCC</strong>).</p></li>
</ul>
<p>This Appendix should be read in conjunction with new proposed section
4.15 – Network Access Quantity.</p>
<p>The <em>Wholesale Electricity Market Amendment (Reserve Capacity
Pricing Reforms) Rules 2019</em> that commenced on 22 February 2020
introduced new provisions for assigning Capacity Credits in scenarios
where no new Facilities wish to receive a fixed Reserve Capacity Price
(<strong>Scenario 1</strong>) and where one or more new Facilities wish
to receive a fixed Reserve Capacity Price (<strong>Scenario
2</strong>).</p>
<p>The NAQ determination process has been designed to accommodate the
changes to the prioritisation order that was introduced by the Reserve
Capacity Mechanism (<strong>RCM</strong>) pricing reforms.</p>
<p><strong>Scenario 1 – there are no nominated Fixed Price
Facilities</strong></p>
<p>If the Reserve Capacity Requirement (<strong>RCR</strong>) is not met
after an NAQ is determined for all existing and committed Facilities,
AEMO will determine a NAQ for proposed Facilities, applying a new
prioritisation order, until the RCR is achieved or there are no
Facilities left.</p>
<p>In accordance with the new prioritisation order, AEMO will not select
a proposed Facility where the NAQ determined for the Facility is less
than a specified minimum quantity of Capacity Credits (the quantity of
which is based on the facility's NAQ) for the Facility to participate in
the RCM.</p>
<p>For the purposes of determining an NAQ for each Facility, using the
NAQ Model to be developed by AEMO in accordance with section 4.15, AEMO
will be required to determine a preliminary NAQ for each Facility and
then adjust (which can only be upwards in a subsequent step) that
preliminary NAQ as preliminary NAQs for other Facilities are
progressively determined in the priority order.</p>
<p><strong>Scenario 2 – there are nominated Fixed Price
Facilities</strong></p>
<p>The process for Scenario 2 is similar to Scenario 1 with some
modifications to reflect the existing priority order with respect to
Facilities that wish to receive a fixed Reserve Capacity Price.</p>
<p>Specifically, unless there is a shortfall in an Availability Class,
NAQs will be determined for Facilities wishing to receive a fixed
Reserve Capacity Price only if the NAQs determined for new market price
Facilities and existing capacity providers is less than the RCR +
3%.</p>
<p>Where there is a shortfall in an Availability Class, NAQs will be
determined for new Facilities that wish to receive a fixed Reserve
Capacity Price that are committed and proposed Facilities, in accordance
with a prioritisation order that includes other Facilities, until the
shortfall is fully covered or there are no Facilities left in the NAQ
Model without a preliminary NAQ (excluding Facilities where the
preliminary NAQ is less than the specified minimum quantity of Capacity
Credits for the facility to participate in the RCM).</p>
<p>However, Appendix 3 is also amended by the Miscellaneous Amendments
No. 1. As Appendix 3 is amended to reflect the amendments contained in
the Tranches 2 and 3 Amendments, as those amending rules (made by the
Minister at the date this companion version was prepared) will be
commenced last, please refer to the Miscellaneous Amendments No. 1 to
see the changes to Appendix 3 that will commence on 1 March 2022 and
apply until the Tranches 2 and 3 Amendments to Appendix 3

<p>To prevent <abbr title="Australian Energy Market Operator">AEMO</abbr> determining Network Access Quantities (and assigning
    Capacity Credits) for Facilities that have been assigned Certified
    Reserve Capacity that have insufficient access to the Network and

    single algorithm is used for testing of Certified Reserve Capacity
    and for determining whether, in respect of a Reserve Capacity Cycle,
    a Network Access Quantity will be determined for any new Candidate
    Fixed Price Facilities for the current Reserve Capacity Cycle. The
    process is:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>where the Facilities, for which Capacity Credits for the current
    &gt; Reserve Capacity Cycle are being sought, do not include a
    &gt; Candidate Fixed Price <abbr title="Has the meaning given in clause 2.29.1B, which can be an unregistered facility or Registered Facility.">Facility</abbr>, set out in Part A; and</p>

<th><p><strong>Explanatory Note</strong></p>
<p>For the 2022 RCC, in which NAQs are to be first determined for
Facilities, AEMO must determine preliminary NAQs for existing and
committed Facilities that are not GIA Facilities, prior to determining
preliminary NAQs for all other Facilities in accordance with the
processes in this Appendix.</p>
<p>At Steps 3A, 3B and 3C, AEMO is required to determine a "preliminary
NAQ" for Facilities for which an NAQ was determined in the RCC
immediately preceding the current RCC, and for Early CRC Facilities
where the current RCC relates to the RCC in which the Facility's Reserve
Capacity will be delivered.</p>
<p>The intent of classifying the NAQ as "preliminary" is because as
other groups of Facilities are added to the NAQ Model and NAQs
determined for them in a subsequent step, an earlier NAQ determination
may need to be adjusted (upwards only). The intent is at the end of all
relevant steps, the preliminary NAQ (as may have been adjusted) is
recorded as the Final NAQ for the Facility. The Final NAQ for a Facility
determines the number of Capacity Credits assigned to the Facility for
the RCC.</p>
<p>The intent of Step 3A is for AEMO to determine a preliminary NAQ for
each Facility by assessing whether the existing NAQ determined for the
Facility in the RCC immediately preceding the current RCC is in order
for the current RCC (0 to min(CRC, current NAQ). In other words:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><blockquote>
<p>verify that the Facility has been assigned Certified Reserve Capacity
in the current RCC (equal to or greater than the NAQ determined for the
Facility in the RCC immediately preceding the current RCC; then</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote>
<p>if the amount of CRC assigned to the Facility in the current RCC is
lower than the NAQ in 1, reduce the NAQ to the amount specified to be
bilaterally traded for the Facility in the current RCC; then</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote>
<p>check whether there has been any organic changes in the network that
reduces the transfer capability of the network and, reduce the NAQ for
affected Facilities accordingly.</p>
</blockquote></li>
</ol>
<p>The intent of Steps 3B and 3C is for AEMO to determine whether there
is NAQ available to NAQ Facilities up to their Highest NAQ (PNAQ to
min(CRC, HNAQ)) and then up to the Certified Reserve Capacity assigned
to the Facility (PNAQ to CRC) respectively.</p>
<p>AEMO is also required to determine (and adjust (upwards only) in a
subsequent step) an Indicative NAQ for Early CRC Facilities (excluding
Early CRC Facilities that are also Network Augmented Funding Facilities)
where the RCC is the "intervening" year for these Facilities.</p></th>

<p>Appendix 5: Individual Reserve Capacity Requirements</p>
<p>This Appendix presents the method that must be used by <abbr title="Australian Energy Market Operator">AEMO</abbr> to
determine, for a Trading Month n:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Individual Reserve Capacity Requirement Contributions as required
    for the determination of Relevant Demands under clause 4.26.2CA;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Indicative Individual Reserve Capacity Requirements as required
    under clause 4.28.6;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Individual Reserve Capacity Requirements as required under clause
    4.28.7; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>revised Individual Reserve Capacity Requirements as required under
    clause 4.28.11A.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><abbr title="Australian Energy Market Operator">AEMO</abbr> must perform Steps 1 to 10A to determine the Indicative Individual
Reserve Capacity Requirements, Individual Reserve Capacity Requirements
or revised Individual Reserve Capacity Requirements for Trading Month n.</p>
<p><abbr title="Australian Energy Market Operator">AEMO</abbr> must perform Step 11 as required to determine the Individual
Reserve Capacity Requirement Contribution of an individual metered
Associated Load for Trading Month n, using as input the relevant values
calculated by <abbr title="Australian Energy Market Operator">AEMO</abbr> when it determined the Indicative Individual Reserve
Capacity Requirements for Trading Month n.</p>
<p>For the purpose of this Appendix:</p>
<p>1. All references, apart from those in Step 5A, to meters are interval
meters.</p>
<p>2. The Notional Wholesale Meter is to be treated as a registered
interval meter measuring Temperature Dependent Load. This meter is
denoted by Temperature Dependent Load meter v=v*.</p>
<p>3. The New Notional Wholesale Meter, determined in accordance with Step
5A, is to be treated as a registered interval meter measuring
Temperature Dependent Load.</p>
<p>4. A meter measuring a <abbr title="Has the meaning given in clause 2.29.1B, which can be an unregistered facility or Registered Facility.">Facility</abbr> containing an Intermittent Load, that
is and continues to be deemed to be an Intermittent Load under clause
1.48.2, is to be included in these calculations as if it were two
meters, one representing the Intermittent Load and included in the set
indexed by w, and one representing other load at the <abbr title="Has the meaning given in clause 2.29.1B, which can be an unregistered facility or Registered Facility.">Facility</abbr> and
included in the set indexed by u or v as applicable, with metered
consumption calculated according to clause 2.30B.10 and clause 11 of
this Appendix 5.</p>
<p>5. A meter measuring a <abbr title="Has the meaning given in clause 2.29.1B, which can be an unregistered facility or Registered Facility.">Facility</abbr> containing an Intermittent Load, for
which an application was approved under clause 2.30B.6 on or after New
<abbr title="Wholesale Energy Market. The market established under section 122 of the Electricity Industry Act.">WEM</abbr> Commencement Day, is to be included in these calculations as a
single meter representing a Non-Dispatchable Load and included in the
set indexed by u or v as applicable, with metered consumption calculated
according to clause 2.30B.11 and clause 12 of this Appendix 5.</p>
<p>6. The meter registration data to be used in the calculations is to be
the most current complete set of meter registration data as at the time
of commencing the calculations.</p>
<p>7. The 12 Peak SWIS Trading Intervals to be used in the calculations
are the 12 Peak SWIS Trading Intervals determined and published by <abbr title="Australian Energy Market Operator">AEMO</abbr>
under clause 4.1.23A for the Hot Season preceding the start of the
Capacity Year in which Trading Month n falls (the “preceding Hot
Season”).</p>
<p>8. The 4 Peak SWIS Trading Intervals for a Trading Month to be used in
the calculations are the 4 Peak SWIS Trading Intervals determined and
published by <abbr title="Australian Energy Market Operator">AEMO</abbr> under clause 4.1.23B for that Trading Month.</p>
<p>9. When calculating the Indicative Individual Reserve Capacity
Requirements it is assumed that all meters registered to a Market
Participant on the day of calculation will remain registered to that
Market Participant for the entirety of Trading Month n.</p>
<p>10. A meter measuring a Scheduled <abbr title="Has the meaning given in clause 2.29.1B, which can be an unregistered facility or Registered Facility.">Facility</abbr>, Semi-Scheduled <abbr title="Has the meaning given in clause 2.29.1B, which can be an unregistered facility or Registered Facility.">Facility</abbr> or
Non-Scheduled <abbr title="Has the meaning given in clause 2.29.1B, which can be an unregistered facility or Registered Facility.">Facility</abbr> not containing an Intermittent Load is to be
included in these calculations and included in the set indexed by u or v
as applicable, with metered consumption calculated in accordance with
clause 12 of this Appendix 5.</p>
<p>11. Each meter measuring an Aggregated <abbr title="Has the meaning given in clause 2.29.1B, which can be an unregistered facility or Registered Facility.">Facility</abbr> is to be included as a
separate meter and included in the set indexed by u or v as applicable,
with metered consumption calculated in accordance with clause 12 of this
Appendix 5.</p>
<p>12. Metered consumption for meter m, in Trading Interval t, is zero
when <abbr title="Australian Energy Market Operator">AEMO</abbr> issues a direction under clause 7.7.5 in respect of an
Electric Storage Resource associated with m for a Dispatch Interval
within t, otherwise it is -1 x min(0, SOMS(m, t)), where SOMS(m, t) is
the Sent Out Metered Schedule of m in t.</p>
<p>Step 1: Calculate:</p>
<p>RR = min(RCR, CC)</p>
<p>FL = FL_RCR × RR / RCR</p>
<p>where:</p>
<p>RCR is the Reserve Capacity Requirement for the relevant Reserve
Capacity Cycle</p>
<p>CC is the total number of Capacity Credits assigned for Trading Month n
at the time of the calculation</p>
<p>FL_RCR is the peak demand associated with the Reserve Capacity
Requirement for the relevant Reserve Capacity Cycle as specified in
clause 4.6.2</p>
<p>Step 2: For each meter, u, measuring Non-Temperature Dependent Load that
was registered with <abbr title="Australian Energy Market Operator">AEMO</abbr> for all of the 12 Peak SWIS Trading Intervals
determine NTDL(u), where:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>NTDL(u) is the contribution to the system peak load of meter u during
the preceding Hot Season where this contribution is double the median
value of the metered consumption during the 12 Peak SWIS Trading
Intervals</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Step 3: For each meter, v, measuring Temperature Dependent Load that was
registered with <abbr title="Australian Energy Market Operator">AEMO</abbr> for all of the 12 Peak SWIS Trading Intervals
determine TDL(v), where:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>TDL(v) is the contribution to the system peak load of meter v during
the preceding Hot Season where this contribution is double the median
value of the metered consumption during the 12 Peak SWIS Trading
Intervals</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Step 4: For each Intermittent Load meter w set its Individual
Intermittent Load Reserve Capacity Requirement, IILRCR(w), to equal the
amount defined in accordance with Appendix 4A.</p>
<p>Step 5: Identify meters that were not registered with <abbr title="Australian Energy Market Operator">AEMO</abbr> during one or
more of the 12 Peak SWIS Trading Intervals but which were registered by
the end of Trading Month n.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For a new meter u that measures Non-Temperature Dependent Load set
NMNTCR(u) to be 1.1 times the MW figure formed by doubling the median
value of the metered consumption for that meter during the 4 Peak SWIS
Trading Intervals of Trading Month n-3.</p>
<p>For a new meter v that measures Temperature Dependent Load set
NMTDCR(v) to be 1.3 times the MW figure formed by doubling the median
value of the metered consumption for that meter during the 4 Peak SWIS
Trading Intervals of Trading Month n-3.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Step 5A:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Find the MW figure formed by doubling the median value of the metered
consumption for the Notional Wholesale Meter v*, during the 4 Peak
SWIS Trading Intervals of Trading Month n-3 (“Median Notional
Wholesale Meter”).</p>
<p>Divide the Median Notional Wholesale Meter by the number of
non-interval or accumulation meters that existed at the end of Trading
Month n-3 (“Average Non - Interval Meter”).</p>
<p>Subtract the number of non-interval or accumulation meters
disconnected between the end of the preceding Hot Season and the end
of Trading Month n-3 from the number of non-interval or accumulation
meters connected between the end of the preceding Hot Season and the
end of Trading Month n-3 (“Non-Interval Meter Growth”).</p>
<p>Multiply the Non-Interval Meter Growth and the Average Non-Interval
Meter. (“New Notional Wholesale Meter”).</p>
<p>For the New Notional Wholesale Meter set NMTDCR(v) equal to be 1.3
times the New Notional Wholesale Meter.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Step 6: Calculate the values of d(u,i) for Non-Temperature Dependent
Load, d(v,i) for Temperature Dependent Loads and d(w,i) for Intermittent
Loads such that:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>d(u,i) has a value of zero if meter u measures Intermittent Load or
    was not registered to Market Participant i during Trading Month n,
    otherwise it has a value equal to the number of full Trading Days
    the meter was registered to Market Participant i in Trading Month n
    divided by the number of days in Trading Month n.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>d(v,i) has a value of zero if meter v measures Intermittent Load or
    was not registered to Market Participant i during Trading Month n,
    otherwise it has a value equal to the number of full Trading Days
    the meter was registered to Market Participant i in Trading Month n
    divided by the number of days in Trading Month n.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>d(w,i) has a value of zero if meter w was not registered to Market
    Participant i during Trading Month n, otherwise it has a value of
    one if Market Participant i nominated capacity for the Intermittent
    Load measured by meter w in accordance with clause 4.28.8(c), with
    the exception that if the Intermittent Load was for Load at a meter
    registered to Market Participant i for only part of Trading Month n,
    then it has a value equal to the number of full Trading Days that
    meter was registered to Market Participant i in Trading Month n
    divided by the number of days in Trading Month n.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Step 7: Identify the set NM of all those new meters v that measured
consumption that was measured by meter v=v* during the preceding Hot
Season and set TDLn(v) for meter v=v* to equal:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>TDLn(v*) = TDL(v*) – Sum(v∈NM, NMTDCR(v))</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Step 8: For each Market Participant i, calculate:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>ILRCR(i) = Sum(IILRCR(w) × d(w,i))</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Step 8A: Calculate:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>NRR = RR – Sum(i, ILRCR(i))</p>
<p>NTDL_Ratio = NRR / FL</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Step 8B: For each Market Participant i, calculate:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>NTDLRCR(i) = Sum(NTDL(u) × d(u,i)) × NTDL_Ratio</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Step 8C: Calculate:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>TDL_Ratio = (NRR ‑ Sum(i, NTDLRCR(i))) /<br />
Sum(i, Sum(MTDL(v) × d(v,i)))</p>
<p>where</p>
<p>MTDL(v) = TDL(v) for all v except v* and<br />
MTDL(v) = TDLn(v*) for v=v*</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Step 8D: For each Market Participant i, calculate:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>TDLRCR(i) = (Sum MTDL(v) × d(v,i)) × TDL_Ratio</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Step 9: For each Market Participant i, calculate</p>
<blockquote>
<p>X(i) = Sum(i, ILRCR(i) + NTDLRCR(i) + TDLRCR(i)) + Sum(u, NMNTCR(u) ×
d(u,i)) + Sum(v, NMTDCR(v) × d(v,i))</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Step 10: Calculate:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Total_Ratio = RR / Sum(i, X(i))</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Step 10A: For each Market Participant i, set the Indicative Individual
Reserve Capacity Requirement or Individual Reserve Capacity Requirement,
as applicable, for Trading Month n to:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>X(i) × Total_Ratio</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Step 11: The Individual Reserve Capacity Requirement Contribution of an
individual metered Associated Load for Trading Month n of a Capacity
Year is determined as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span class="arithmatex">\(a\)</span> for meter u at a connection point measuring Non-Temperature
Dependent Load that was registered with <abbr title="Australian Energy Market Operator">AEMO</abbr> for all of the 12 Peak
SWIS Trading Intervals equals (NTDL(u) x NTDL_Ratio x Total_Ratio);</p>
<p><span class="arithmatex">\(b\)</span> for meter v at a connection point measuring Temperature
Dependent Load that was registered with <abbr title="Australian Energy Market Operator">AEMO</abbr> for all of the 12 Peak

<p><span class="arithmatex">\(c\)</span> for meter u at a new connection point identified in Step 5

<p>Amendments are for clarity. An alternative definition for
'Electricity Storage' to that which exists in the WEM Rules is used in
this Appendix 12. This is because the GPS definition specifically
“excludes” non-dispatchable storage, whereas the WEM Rules definition is
quite open-ended, as controllability comes down to how a Facility is
registered. This definition maintains, for GPS purposes, a limitation to
only storage devices that are dispatchable.</p></td>
