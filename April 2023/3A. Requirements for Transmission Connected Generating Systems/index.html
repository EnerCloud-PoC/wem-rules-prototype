<p>Section 3A.5 sets out the approval process and negotiation framework
for determining generator performance standards for Market Participants
wishing to connect generating systems to the transmission network. The
applicable standards are set out as Technical Requirements under
Appendix 12. For most Technical Requirements, there is an Ideal
Generator Performance Standard and a Minimum Generator Performance
Standard. The Network Operator must accept a Proposed Generator
Performance Standard that meets the Ideal Generator Performance Standard
and must reject any proposed standard below the Minimum Generator
Performance Standard. Where a Proposed Generator Performance Standard is
between the range of minimum and ideal, the generator must adequately
justify why it cannot achieve the Ideal Generator Performance Standard.
The Network Operator must consult with AEMO on any negotiated standard
that it is likely to accept, and is not permitted to accept the standard
unless AEMO also agrees. If rejecting a Proposed Generator Performance
Standard, the Network Operator and AEMO must provide reasons.</p>
<p>A Market Participant may propose a Trigger Event. If an approved
Trigger Event occurs then the Market Participant must comply with the
conditions of the Trigger Event.</p>
<p>Once approved, the generator performance standards for a Transmission
Connected Generating System must be recorded on the Generator
