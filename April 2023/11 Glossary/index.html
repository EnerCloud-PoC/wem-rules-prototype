<p>The quantity of Contingency Reserve Raise that a Facility is cleared
for is not a part of setting the Contingency Reserve Requirement under
the Dispatch Algorithm. This is due to the fact that the Dispatch

cost recovery is more reflective of the requirement.</p></th>

<p>Currently a Market Participant must submit in its Balancing
Submissions prices and quantities at which it is willing to dispatch its
Facilities. If plant is unavailable this must be declared and be
accompanied by either a planned or forced outage declaration. As a
result there will be direct financial consequences for the Market
Participant in the RCM. All plant which is declared “available” would be
subject to receiving a dispatch instruction if it is in merit. Again,
there will be consequences for the Market Participant if it is unable to
respond to a Dispatch Instruction.</p>
<p>However, under the new changes to the availability declarations, a
declaration “Available but not in service” could allow a Market
Participant to avoid being dispatched while still declaring it is
available in its real time market submissions. Even if it is in merit it
will not be issued a dispatch instructions unless it changes its status
to in service.</p>

<th><p><strong>Explanatory Note</strong></p>
<p>The definition of Small Aggregation as a Facility Technology Type
will be reviewed holistically with both the policy intent for facility
aggregation (at both transmission and distribution level) as well as how
DER is to participate in the WEM in the future. However, for the
purposes of the RCM, the definition of Small Aggregation as set out
below suffices to enable distributed energy resources to aggregate
behind the same TNI and participate in the RCM. These small aggregations
are expected to be registered as Non-Scheduled Facilities.</p>
<p>The definition of System Size considers contracted access to the
market which estimates the impact of a facility on the market. This
definition also explicitly references the charge and discharge
capability of Electric Storage Resources and this avoids the need to
specify single cycle changes. System Size is used in sections 2.28 and
2.29 of the Tranches 2 and 3 Amendments in the context of energy
producing systems at unregistered facilities and therefore the
definition has changed Facility to facility to account for both
registered and unregistered facilities. The definition of System Size
uses the term energy producing equipment instead of energy producing
system to denote the fact that the system comprises the entirety of all
generating and storage equipment at the facility.</p></th>

<th><p><strong>Explanatory Note</strong></p>
<p>This runway calculation does not include Intermittent Loads.
Intermittent Loads will be added to the runway calculation in a future
tranche of Amending Rules once the registration framework is
finalised.</p>
<p>1.1 This Appendix 2A sets out the steps that are to be followed by
AEMO in determining <em>TotalRunwayShare(p,DI)</em>, being the
allocation share of Market Participant p in Dispatch Interval DI for the
costs of procuring:</p>
<p>(a) Contingency Reserve Raise (see clause 9.10.30); and</p>
<p>(b) Additional RoCoF Control Requirement component of RoCoF Control
Service (see clause 9.10.34)</p>
<p>by use of a "modified runway allocation method" for each Dispatch
Interval allocating the share of the costs above to Market Participants
based on their Facility Risk (see Glossary) in the Dispatch
Interval.</p>
<p>1.2 The cost of procuring Contingency Reserve Raise and Additional
RoCoF Control Requirement component of RoCoF Control Service (jointly
referred to as the relevant Essential System Service) is allocated to
Registered Facilities with a Facility Risk greater than 10MW (see Clause
2.3 of this Appendix 2A).</p>
<p>1.3 The cost of procuring the relevant Essential System Service is
split into two components (see clause 5.1 of this Appendix 2A):</p>
<p>(a) A Network Component - this is calculated in clause 5.1(a) of this
Appendix 2A:</p>
<p>(i) This component is zero if the Largest Credible Supply Contingency
is not set by a Network Contingency. It is also zero if the Largest
Network Risk equals the Largest Facility Risk (i.e. a Facility
Contingency and Network Contingency are tied as the Largest Credible
Supply Contingency).</p>
<p>(ii) This component is non-zero if the Largest Credible Supply
Contingency is set by a Network Contingency and is not set by a Facility
Contingency as the Largest Credible Supply Contingency. In this case,
the share Network Component is calculated as the ratio of</p>
<p>(A) the difference between the Largest Network Risk and the Largest
Facility Risk; and</p>
<p>(B) the Largest Network Risk.</p>
<p>(iii) This ensures that causers of Network Contingencies only
pay:</p>
<p>(A) when their Network Contingency sets the Contingency Reserve Raise
Requirement;</p>
<p>(B) a delta - in that their cost allocation is based on the
additional relevant Essential System Service procured as a result of
their Network Contingency setting the Contingency Reserve Raise
Requirement.</p>
<p><em>For example, if Largest Network Risk = 300 (set by region A) and
Largest Facility Risk = 240 (set by generator X), then the causers of
the Region A Network Contingency would pay (300-240)/300 = 20% of the
relevant Essential System Service costs in a given Dispatch
Interval.</em></p>
<p>(iv) If two or more Network Contingencies set the Largest Credible
Supply contingency, then each tied Network Contingency is allocated an
equal share of the Network Component.</p>
<p><em>For example, if two Network Contingencies were tied with Largest
Network Risk = 300 (set by region A and region B) in the example above,
then the causers of the each Network Contingency would pay 20%/2 = 10%
of the relevant Essential System Service costs in a given Dispatch
Interval.</em></p>
<p>(b) A Facility Component (see clause 5.1(b) of this Appendix 2A)
which equals one minus the Network Component calculated above. This
component equals 100% if a Facility Contingency sets the Largest
Credible Supply Contingency.</p>
<p>1.4 Appendix 2A calculates runway shares for Registered Facilities
separately for:</p>
<p>(a) Facilities deemed to be causers of Facility Contingencies (see
Section 3 of this Appendix 2A: Applicable Facility Shares, and clause
3.3 of this Appendix 2A, which calculates the runway shares)</p>
<p>(b) Facilities deemed to be causers of Network Contingencies (see
Section 4 of this Appendix A: Network Contingency Shares, and clause 4.5
of this Appendix 2A, which calculates the runway shares)</p>
<p>Runway shares are calculated by ranking each Facility’s Facility Risk
value, and allocating them a share based on their rank (similar to the
calculation in Appendix 2 of the current WEM Rules).</p>
<p>1.5 Once the runway shares above have been calculated, participant
cost shares (<em>TotalRunwayShare(p,DI)</em>) are calculated in clause
5.3 of this Appendix 2A by taking into account:</p>
<p>(a) The Facility Component and Network Component ratios calculated in
clause 5.1 of this Appendix 2A</p>
<p>(b) The number of Network Contingencies tied as the Largest Credible
Supply Contingency (if any) in clause 5.2 of this Appendix 2A</p>
<p>(c) The facility runway shares and the network runway shares
calculated in clauses 3.3 and 4.5 of this Appendix 2A respectively.</p>
<p>Appendix 2A is also amended to include unregistered Energy Producing
Systems serving Intermittent Loads. If the Market Participant
responsible for the Non-Dispatchable Load portion of a Facility
containing an Intermittent Load is different from the Market Participant
responsible for the Registered Facility component, the runway share will
be allocated to:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>the Registered Facility when total facility export is greater
than the output of any one behind the meter unit; or</p></li>
<li><p>the Non-Dispatchable Load when the output of any one behind the
meter unit is greater than total Facility export.</p></li>

<p>1.1 The Minimum RoCoF Control Requirement component of the RoCoF
Control Service costs (abbreviated to RoCoF cost in this section) in a
Trading Interval are to be shared across three causer groups in equal
shares:</p>
<p>(a) <em>Network Causer group</em>: Network Operators (this group has
one member only);</p>
<p>(b) <em>Injection Causer group</em>: Registered Facilities with
generation systems or storage systems (i.e. energy producing systems);
and</p>
<p>(c) <em>Offtake Causer group</em>: Non-Dispatchable Loads and
Registered Facilities comprising only Scheduled Loads (end-users).</p>
<p>1.2 Members of each group can exempt themselves by indicating to AEMO
that the RoCoF Ridethrough Capability of their facilities are greater
than or equal to the RoCoF Safe Limit.</p>
<p>1.3 The RoCoF costs will be allocated to those causers who cannot
exempt themselves.</p>
<p>1.4 If all facilities in a causer set are exempt then the RoCoF cost
is allocated equally to the remaining sets. This is represented by the
parameter (1/n(t)) in clause 2.4 in this Appendix 2B.</p>
<p>1.5 A Registered Facility which is able to inject (i.e. generate
energy) is only included in the Injection Causer group if it does not
have an exemption and has a non-zero metered schedule in the given
trading interval. The cost share of injectors who are causers will be
based on their share of Injection/Withdrawal during the Trading
Interval.</p>
<p>1.6 Loads are deemed to be Non-Dispatchable Loads who are served by a
retailer or Registered Facilities comprising only Scheduled Loads. These
Load facilities are only included in the Offtake Causer group if they do
not have an exemption and have a non-zero metered schedule in the given
trading interval. It is expected that the Retailer would indicate to
AEMO whether their loads have a RoCoF Ridethrough Capability greater
than or equal to the RoCoF Safe Limit. The cost share of Load facilities
who are causers will also be based on their share of
Injection/Withdrawal during the Trading Interval.</p></th>

<p>Injection Causer: These are generators whose RoCoF ridethrough
capability is lower than the RoCoF Safe Limit. As per above, the
expectation is that most generators will be able to exempt themselves by
indicating a high RoCoF ridethrough capability. Transitional rules will

their ride-through capability.</p>
<p>Note that a battery is deemed an Injection Causer and not an Offtake

demonstrate their ride-through capability. This group will likely
comprise of Non-Dispatchable Loads that are unable to demonstrate
ride-through against the RoCoF Safe Limit.</p>
<p>A given facility can only be a member of one Causer Group. That is,
facilities would not change between causer groups depending on whether
they are injecting or consuming. Causer Group membership is determined
by the type of facility (in terms of equipment, technical
characteristics, etc.) as opposed to whether the facility is generating
or consuming.</p>
<p>A clause X will be inserted (likely in standing data) dealing with
RoCoF exemption by the registration or transition rules workstream at a
later time. This clause would be tied to the relevant causer’s RoCoF
ridethrough capability vis a vis the RoCoF Safe Limit; in that if the
ride-through capability is greater than or equal to the safe limit, the
facility is exempt from paying the Minimum RoCoF Control Requirement
component of RoCoF Control Service cost.</p>

<p>This section defines the various availability parameters that form
part of a SESSM Award. These parameters are defined in the Glossary.</p>

respect of a Facility to provide a Frequency Co-optimised Essential
System Service (FCESS)):</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The BaseQuantity(a,DI) or the Base ESS Quantity, denotes the MW
or MWs quantity of Essential System Service the Facility was already
accredited for at the time of making the SESSM Submission that resulted
in award a. The Base Quantity can be different in different Dispatch
Intervals. For example:</p></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><blockquote>
<p>Facility X has been accredited for 25MW of Contingency Reserve Raise
(with no SESSM triggered). A SESSM is triggered and Facility X has now
been awarded an Availability Quantity of 15 MW in all Dispatch Intervals
(under award a). The Base ESS Quantity or Base Quantity(a, DI) =
25MW.</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote>
<p>Facility Y is a new Facility, and is applying under a SESSM to
provide FCESS. Y is awarded an Availability Quantity of 10MW in all
Dispatch Intervals, under award a1. The Base Quantity(a, DI) = 0 MW for
all Dispatch Intervals (because it was not accredited previously). At a
later stage, it undergoes an upgrade, and under SESSM Award a2, it is
awarded an additional Availability Quantity (over and above a1) of 5MW
in all Dispatch Intervals. Base Quantity(a2,DI) = 10 MW, which is the
maximum that Y was accredited for under award a1 (at the time they were
awarded a2).</p>
</blockquote></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><p>The AvailabilityQuantity(a,DI) or Availability Quantity, denotes
the MW or MWs quantity of the ESS the Facility must offer in addition to
the Base ESS Quantity in a given Dispatch in at least
MinAvailability(a)% (see below) of the time during the SESSM Service
Timing. The Availability Quantity can be different in different Dispatch
Intervals. The Market Participant must offer the sum of the relevant
Availability Quantity and Base ESS Quantity (for a given SESSM Award
a):</p></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><blockquote>
<p>In the example above, Facility X, must offer 25MW (Base ESS Quantity)
+ 15MW (Availability Quantity) = 40 MW in all Dispatch Intervals</p>
</blockquote></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><blockquote>
<p>In the second example, above:</p>
</blockquote>
<p> Under award a1, Y must provide offer 0MW (Base ESS Quantity) + 10MW
(Availability Quantity) = 10 MW in all Dispatch Intervals.</p>
<p> Under award a2, Y must provide offer 10MW (Base ESS Quantity) + 5MW
(Availability Quantity) = 15 MW in all Dispatch Intervals</p></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><p>The AvailabilityPayment(a,DI) or Per-Dispatch Interval
Availability Payment, is the price per Dispatch Interval that the Market
Participant will be paid for offering the Availability Quantity in a
given Dispatch Interval. The Availability Payment is zero in intervals
where the Availability Quantity is zero, and is a flat $/Dispatch
Interval figure in Dispatch Intervals where Availability Quantity is
non-zero.</p></li>
<li><p>MinAvailability(a) or SESSM Minimum Availability Requirement,
denotes the % of relevant Dispatch Intervals that the Market Participant
must make the sum of the AvailabilityQuantity(a,DI) and
BaseQuantity(a,DI) available (i.e. the Market Participant must make all
of that quantity available at least MinAvailability % of the applicable
Dispatch Intervals).</p></li>

<p>Appendix 3 is amended to:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>remove the Reserve Capacity Auction; and</p></li>
<li><p>prescribe the prioritisation order for determining Network Access
Quantities (<strong>NAQ</strong>) for Facilities for a Reserve Capacity
Cycle (<strong>RCC</strong>).</p></li>
</ul>
<p>This Appendix should be read in conjunction with new proposed section
4.15 – Network Access Quantity.</p>
<p>The <em>Wholesale Electricity Market Amendment (Reserve Capacity
Pricing Reforms) Rules 2019</em> that commenced on 22 February 2020
introduced new provisions for assigning Capacity Credits in scenarios
where no new Facilities wish to receive a fixed Reserve Capacity Price
(<strong>Scenario 1</strong>) and where one or more new Facilities wish
to receive a fixed Reserve Capacity Price (<strong>Scenario
2</strong>).</p>
<p>The NAQ determination process has been designed to accommodate the
changes to the prioritisation order that was introduced by the Reserve
Capacity Mechanism (<strong>RCM</strong>) pricing reforms.</p>
<p><strong>Scenario 1 – there are no nominated Fixed Price
Facilities</strong></p>
<p>If the Reserve Capacity Requirement (<strong>RCR</strong>) is not met
after an NAQ is determined for all existing and committed Facilities,
AEMO will determine a NAQ for proposed Facilities, applying a new
prioritisation order, until the RCR is achieved or there are no
Facilities left.</p>
<p>In accordance with the new prioritisation order, AEMO will not select
a proposed Facility where the NAQ determined for the Facility is less
than a specified minimum quantity of Capacity Credits (the quantity of
which is based on the facility's NAQ) for the Facility to participate in
the RCM.</p>
<p>For the purposes of determining an NAQ for each Facility, using the
NAQ Model to be developed by AEMO in accordance with section 4.15, AEMO
will be required to determine a preliminary NAQ for each Facility and
then adjust (which can only be upwards in a subsequent step) that
preliminary NAQ as preliminary NAQs for other Facilities are
progressively determined in the priority order.</p>
<p><strong>Scenario 2 – there are nominated Fixed Price
Facilities</strong></p>
<p>The process for Scenario 2 is similar to Scenario 1 with some
modifications to reflect the existing priority order with respect to
Facilities that wish to receive a fixed Reserve Capacity Price.</p>
<p>Specifically, unless there is a shortfall in an Availability Class,
NAQs will be determined for Facilities wishing to receive a fixed
Reserve Capacity Price only if the NAQs determined for new market price
Facilities and existing capacity providers is less than the RCR +
3%.</p>
<p>Where there is a shortfall in an Availability Class, NAQs will be
determined for new Facilities that wish to receive a fixed Reserve
Capacity Price that are committed and proposed Facilities, in accordance
with a prioritisation order that includes other Facilities, until the
shortfall is fully covered or there are no Facilities left in the NAQ
Model without a preliminary NAQ (excluding Facilities where the
preliminary NAQ is less than the specified minimum quantity of Capacity
Credits for the facility to participate in the RCM).</p>
<p>However, Appendix 3 is also amended by the Miscellaneous Amendments
No. 1. As Appendix 3 is amended to reflect the amendments contained in
the Tranches 2 and 3 Amendments, as those amending rules (made by the
Minister at the date this companion version was prepared) will be
commenced last, please refer to the Miscellaneous Amendments No. 1 to
see the changes to Appendix 3 that will commence on 1 March 2022 and
apply until the Tranches 2 and 3 Amendments to Appendix 3

<p>Appendix 3: Determination of Network Access Quantities</p>
<p>The objectives of this appendix are:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>To prevent <abbr title="Australian Energy Market Operator">AEMO</abbr> determining Network Access Quantities (and assigning
    Capacity Credits) for Facilities that have been assigned Certified
    Reserve Capacity that have insufficient access to the Network and
    availability to usefully address the Reserve Capacity Requirement. A
    single algorithm is used for testing of Certified Reserve Capacity
    and for determining whether, in respect of a Reserve Capacity Cycle,
    a Network Access Quantity will be determined for any new Candidate
    Fixed Price Facilities for the current Reserve Capacity Cycle. The
    process is:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>where the Facilities, for which Capacity Credits for the current
    &gt; Reserve Capacity Cycle are being sought, do not include a
    &gt; Candidate Fixed Price <abbr title="Has the meaning given in clause 2.29.1B, which can be an unregistered facility or Registered Facility.">Facility</abbr>, set out in Part A; and</p>

<th><p><strong>Explanatory Note</strong></p>
<p>For the 2022 RCC, in which NAQs are to be first determined for
Facilities, AEMO must determine preliminary NAQs for existing and
committed Facilities that are not GIA Facilities, prior to determining
preliminary NAQs for all other Facilities in accordance with the
processes in this Appendix.</p>
<p>At Steps 3A, 3B and 3C, AEMO is required to determine a "preliminary
NAQ" for Facilities for which an NAQ was determined in the RCC
immediately preceding the current RCC, and for Early CRC Facilities
where the current RCC relates to the RCC in which the Facility's Reserve
Capacity will be delivered.</p>
<p>The intent of classifying the NAQ as "preliminary" is because as
other groups of Facilities are added to the NAQ Model and NAQs
determined for them in a subsequent step, an earlier NAQ determination
may need to be adjusted (upwards only). The intent is at the end of all
relevant steps, the preliminary NAQ (as may have been adjusted) is
recorded as the Final NAQ for the Facility. The Final NAQ for a Facility
determines the number of Capacity Credits assigned to the Facility for
the RCC.</p>
<p>The intent of Step 3A is for AEMO to determine a preliminary NAQ for
each Facility by assessing whether the existing NAQ determined for the
Facility in the RCC immediately preceding the current RCC is in order
for the current RCC (0 to min(CRC, current NAQ). In other words:</p>

</ul>
<p><abbr title="Australian Energy Market Operator">AEMO</abbr> must perform Steps 1 to 10A to determine the Indicative Individual
Reserve Capacity Requirements, Individual Reserve Capacity Requirements
or revised Individual Reserve Capacity Requirements for Trading Month n.</p>
<p><abbr title="Australian Energy Market Operator">AEMO</abbr> must perform Step 11 as required to determine the Individual
Reserve Capacity Requirement Contribution of an individual metered
Associated Load for Trading Month n, using as input the relevant values
calculated by <abbr title="Australian Energy Market Operator">AEMO</abbr> when it determined the Indicative Individual Reserve
Capacity Requirements for Trading Month n.</p>
<p>For the purpose of this Appendix:</p>
<p>1. All references, apart from those in Step 5A, to meters are interval
meters.</p>
<p>2. The Notional Wholesale Meter is to be treated as a registered
interval meter measuring Temperature Dependent Load. This meter is
denoted by Temperature Dependent Load meter v=v*.</p>
<p>3. The New Notional Wholesale Meter, determined in accordance with Step
5A, is to be treated as a registered interval meter measuring
Temperature Dependent Load.</p>
<p>4. A meter measuring a <abbr title="Has the meaning given in clause 2.29.1B, which can be an unregistered facility or Registered Facility.">Facility</abbr> containing an Intermittent Load, that
is and continues to be deemed to be an Intermittent Load under clause
1.48.2, is to be included in these calculations as if it were two

indexed by w, and one representing other load at the <abbr title="Has the meaning given in clause 2.29.1B, which can be an unregistered facility or Registered Facility.">Facility</abbr> and
included in the set indexed by u or v as applicable, with metered
consumption calculated according to clause 2.30B.10 and clause 11 of
this Appendix 5.</p>
<p>5. A meter measuring a <abbr title="Has the meaning given in clause 2.29.1B, which can be an unregistered facility or Registered Facility.">Facility</abbr> containing an Intermittent Load, for
which an application was approved under clause 2.30B.6 on or after New

single meter representing a Non-Dispatchable Load and included in the
set indexed by u or v as applicable, with metered consumption calculated
according to clause 2.30B.11 and clause 12 of this Appendix 5.</p>
<p>6. The meter registration data to be used in the calculations is to be
the most current complete set of meter registration data as at the time
of commencing the calculations.</p>
<p>7. The 12 Peak SWIS Trading Intervals to be used in the calculations
are the 12 Peak SWIS Trading Intervals determined and published by <abbr title="Australian Energy Market Operator">AEMO</abbr>
under clause 4.1.23A for the Hot Season preceding the start of the
Capacity Year in which Trading Month n falls (the “preceding Hot
Season”).</p>
<p>8. The 4 Peak SWIS Trading Intervals for a Trading Month to be used in
the calculations are the 4 Peak SWIS Trading Intervals determined and
published by <abbr title="Australian Energy Market Operator">AEMO</abbr> under clause 4.1.23B for that Trading Month.</p>
<p>9. When calculating the Indicative Individual Reserve Capacity
Requirements it is assumed that all meters registered to a Market
Participant on the day of calculation will remain registered to that
Market Participant for the entirety of Trading Month n.</p>
<p>10. A meter measuring a Scheduled <abbr title="Has the meaning given in clause 2.29.1B, which can be an unregistered facility or Registered Facility.">Facility</abbr>, Semi-Scheduled <abbr title="Has the meaning given in clause 2.29.1B, which can be an unregistered facility or Registered Facility.">Facility</abbr> or
Non-Scheduled <abbr title="Has the meaning given in clause 2.29.1B, which can be an unregistered facility or Registered Facility.">Facility</abbr> not containing an Intermittent Load is to be
included in these calculations and included in the set indexed by u or v
as applicable, with metered consumption calculated in accordance with
clause 12 of this Appendix 5.</p>
<p>11. Each meter measuring an Aggregated <abbr title="Has the meaning given in clause 2.29.1B, which can be an unregistered facility or Registered Facility.">Facility</abbr> is to be included as a
separate meter and included in the set indexed by u or v as applicable,
with metered consumption calculated in accordance with clause 12 of this
Appendix 5.</p>
<p>12. Metered consumption for meter m, in Trading Interval t, is zero
when <abbr title="Australian Energy Market Operator">AEMO</abbr> issues a direction under clause 7.7.5 in respect of an
Electric Storage Resource associated with m for a Dispatch Interval
within t, otherwise it is -1 x min(0, SOMS(m, t)), where SOMS(m, t) is
the Sent Out Metered Schedule of m in t.</p>
<p>Step 1: Calculate:</p>
<p>RR = min(RCR, CC)</p>
<p>FL = FL_RCR × RR / RCR</p>
<p>where:</p>
<p>RCR is the Reserve Capacity Requirement for the relevant Reserve
Capacity Cycle</p>
<p>CC is the total number of Capacity Credits assigned for Trading Month n
at the time of the calculation</p>
<p>FL_RCR is the peak demand associated with the Reserve Capacity
Requirement for the relevant Reserve Capacity Cycle as specified in
clause 4.6.2</p>
<p>Step 2: For each meter, u, measuring Non-Temperature Dependent Load that
was registered with <abbr title="Australian Energy Market Operator">AEMO</abbr> for all of the 12 Peak SWIS Trading Intervals
determine NTDL(u), where:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>NTDL(u) is the contribution to the system peak load of meter u during
the preceding Hot Season where this contribution is double the median
value of the metered consumption during the 12 Peak SWIS Trading
Intervals</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Step 3: For each meter, v, measuring Temperature Dependent Load that was
registered with <abbr title="Australian Energy Market Operator">AEMO</abbr> for all of the 12 Peak SWIS Trading Intervals
determine TDL(v), where:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>TDL(v) is the contribution to the system peak load of meter v during
the preceding Hot Season where this contribution is double the median
value of the metered consumption during the 12 Peak SWIS Trading
Intervals</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Step 4: For each Intermittent Load meter w set its Individual
Intermittent Load Reserve Capacity Requirement, IILRCR(w), to equal the
amount defined in accordance with Appendix 4A.</p>
<p>Step 5: Identify meters that were not registered with <abbr title="Australian Energy Market Operator">AEMO</abbr> during one or
more of the 12 Peak SWIS Trading Intervals but which were registered by
the end of Trading Month n.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For a new meter u that measures Non-Temperature Dependent Load set
NMNTCR(u) to be 1.1 times the MW figure formed by doubling the median
value of the metered consumption for that meter during the 4 Peak SWIS
Trading Intervals of Trading Month n-3.</p>
<p>For a new meter v that measures Temperature Dependent Load set
NMTDCR(v) to be 1.3 times the MW figure formed by doubling the median
value of the metered consumption for that meter during the 4 Peak SWIS
Trading Intervals of Trading Month n-3.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Step 5A:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Find the MW figure formed by doubling the median value of the metered
consumption for the Notional Wholesale Meter v*, during the 4 Peak
SWIS Trading Intervals of Trading Month n-3 (“Median Notional
Wholesale Meter”).</p>
<p>Divide the Median Notional Wholesale Meter by the number of
non-interval or accumulation meters that existed at the end of Trading
Month n-3 (“Average Non - Interval Meter”).</p>
<p>Subtract the number of non-interval or accumulation meters
disconnected between the end of the preceding Hot Season and the end
of Trading Month n-3 from the number of non-interval or accumulation
meters connected between the end of the preceding Hot Season and the
end of Trading Month n-3 (“Non-Interval Meter Growth”).</p>
<p>Multiply the Non-Interval Meter Growth and the Average Non-Interval
Meter. (“New Notional Wholesale Meter”).</p>
<p>For the New Notional Wholesale Meter set NMTDCR(v) equal to be 1.3
times the New Notional Wholesale Meter.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Step 6: Calculate the values of d(u,i) for Non-Temperature Dependent
Load, d(v,i) for Temperature Dependent Loads and d(w,i) for Intermittent
Loads such that:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>d(u,i) has a value of zero if meter u measures Intermittent Load or
    was not registered to Market Participant i during Trading Month n,
    otherwise it has a value equal to the number of full Trading Days
    the meter was registered to Market Participant i in Trading Month n
    divided by the number of days in Trading Month n.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>d(v,i) has a value of zero if meter v measures Intermittent Load or
    was not registered to Market Participant i during Trading Month n,
    otherwise it has a value equal to the number of full Trading Days
    the meter was registered to Market Participant i in Trading Month n
    divided by the number of days in Trading Month n.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>d(w,i) has a value of zero if meter w was not registered to Market
    Participant i during Trading Month n, otherwise it has a value of
    one if Market Participant i nominated capacity for the Intermittent
    Load measured by meter w in accordance with clause 4.28.8(c), with
    the exception that if the Intermittent Load was for Load at a meter
    registered to Market Participant i for only part of Trading Month n,
    then it has a value equal to the number of full Trading Days that
    meter was registered to Market Participant i in Trading Month n
    divided by the number of days in Trading Month n.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Step 7: Identify the set NM of all those new meters v that measured
consumption that was measured by meter v=v* during the preceding Hot
Season and set TDLn(v) for meter v=v* to equal:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>TDLn(v*) = TDL(v*) – Sum(v∈NM, NMTDCR(v))</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Step 8: For each Market Participant i, calculate:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>ILRCR(i) = Sum(IILRCR(w) × d(w,i))</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Step 8A: Calculate:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>NRR = RR – Sum(i, ILRCR(i))</p>
<p>NTDL_Ratio = NRR / FL</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Step 8B: For each Market Participant i, calculate:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>NTDLRCR(i) = Sum(NTDL(u) × d(u,i)) × NTDL_Ratio</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Step 8C: Calculate:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>TDL_Ratio = (NRR ‑ Sum(i, NTDLRCR(i))) /<br />
Sum(i, Sum(MTDL(v) × d(v,i)))</p>
<p>where</p>
<p>MTDL(v) = TDL(v) for all v except v* and<br />
MTDL(v) = TDLn(v*) for v=v*</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Step 8D: For each Market Participant i, calculate:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>TDLRCR(i) = (Sum MTDL(v) × d(v,i)) × TDL_Ratio</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Step 9: For each Market Participant i, calculate</p>
<blockquote>
<p>X(i) = Sum(i, ILRCR(i) + NTDLRCR(i) + TDLRCR(i)) + Sum(u, NMNTCR(u) ×
d(u,i)) + Sum(v, NMTDCR(v) × d(v,i))</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Step 10: Calculate:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Total_Ratio = RR / Sum(i, X(i))</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Step 10A: For each Market Participant i, set the Indicative Individual
Reserve Capacity Requirement or Individual Reserve Capacity Requirement,
as applicable, for Trading Month n to:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>X(i) × Total_Ratio</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Step 11: The Individual Reserve Capacity Requirement Contribution of an
individual metered Associated Load for Trading Month n of a Capacity
Year is determined as follows:</p>
<blockquote>

<p>For the purpose of this Appendix:</p>
<ul>
<li>

    commences its calculations);</p>
</li>
<li>

<li>
<p>If the identity of the interval meter is provided by the date and
