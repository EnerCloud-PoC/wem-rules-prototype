<p>Clause 1.29.2 requires AEMO to develop a WEM Procedure for DSM
Reserve Capacity Security, which must include the processes relating to
requests under clause 4.13A.18 for DSM Reserve Capacity Security to be
waived or released. A Market Participant with a Demand Side Programme

<th><p><strong>Explanatory Note</strong></p>
<p>The reforms to registration include requiring various participants to
register in different classes to ensure that the relevant obligations
are placed on individual participants or a group of participants with
similar characteristics (in respect of facilities they own, control or
operate). A new registration taxonomy is to be introduced into the WEM.
However, transitional provisions are required so that the new
registration taxonomy applies to Market Participants participating in
the Reserve Capacity Mechanism for the 2021, 2022 and 2023 Reserve
Capacity Cycles.</p>
<p>Section 1.45 enables the new registration taxonomy to apply to the
2021, 2022 and 2023 RCM Capacity Cycles while maintaining the existing
registration concepts under the current market arrangements until the
New WEM Commencement Day, which is when the new registration taxonomy
will apply.</p>
<p>The intent of section 1.45 is set out below.</p>
<ul>
<li><blockquote>
<p>Automatically transition (via deeming provisions) all existing Market
Participants (e.g. Market Generators and Market Customers registered
under the current WEM Rules) participating in the 2021, 2022 and 2023
Reserve Capacity Cycles to the relevant RCM Market Participant
class.</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote>
<p>Automatically transition (via deeming provisions) all existing Market
Participants' Registered Facilities to new equivalent Facility Classes
unless certain conditions apply. Where those conditions apply, the
transitional WEM Procedure will apply and AEMO will be required to
determine a different Facility Class as per the new Facility Classes
specified in new section 2.29.</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote>
<p>If there is an existing unregistered facility, the facility will be
assessed as per the new Facility Technology Types specified in new
section 2.29 and will be assigned a Facility Class.</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote>
<p>Any new facility participating in the Reserve Capacity Mechanism for
the first time will be required to follow the processes under Chapter
4.</p>
</blockquote></li>
</ul>
<p>Interruptible Loads are not included in the table as they are not
assigned Capacity Credits.</p></th>

<p>Market Participants can voluntarily participate in trialling central
ramping dispatch of their Facilities to facilitate new market readiness.
The new transitional rules in section 1.51 enable AEMO to take
operational control of a Market Participant’s Facility for this purpose,
while ensuring compliance with Dispatch Instructions as issued under the
current Balancing and LFAS Markets. To the extent AEMO ensures its
operational control of the Facility remains consistent with the
applicable Dispatch Instruction, the Market Participant is required to
maintain its dispatch compliance.</p>
<p>It should be highlighted that these transitional rules do not affect
any existing aspects of market operation or compensation. They are
purely intended for the purposes of testing a Facility’s physical
ability to ramp linearly in response to a Dispatch Instruction in the

<p>The intent of section 1.58 is to ensure that information produced or
exchanged under the current WEM Rules maintains the same confidentiality
status in the new market, but only in so far as the information was
produced or exchanged under the current WEM Rules. In other words, the
same or similar types of information or documents produced or exchanged
under the WEM Rules that will apply from the start of the new market may
be assigned a different confidentiality status (e.g. a type of
information is confidential under the current WEM Rules but is to be
public for the same type of information produced under the new WEM
Rules).</p>
<p>However, as market related information will be classified only as
either Confidential Information or Public Information under the new
Chapter 10 Market Information Framework, the six different
confidentiality classes as per the current classifications (listed in
sub-clause 1.58.3(a)) will be treated as Confidential Information under
the new framework.</p>
<p>Any market related information or documents produced or exchanged
under the current WEM Rules or WEM Procedures that is not specified in
the list published by AEMO on the WEM Website (which was last updated as
at 1 July 2012) or otherwise prescribed a confidentiality status

the new Information Manager in accordance with the new Chapter 10 Market
