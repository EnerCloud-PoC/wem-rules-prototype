<p>Replacement section 3.6 outlines the obligations of AEMO and Network
Operators in relation to managing under frequency load shedding on the
SWIS. AEMO is required to prepare and publish an UFLS Requirements
document to set out the aggregate under frequency load shedding
requirements for the SWIS taking into account the SWIS Frequency
Operating Standards. Network Operators are required to design and
develop UFLS specifications to adhere to the requirements set out by
AEMO. Section 3.6 also sets out obligations for AEMO and Network
Operators to consult with each other when amendments to UFLS
Requirements are necessary and to monitor ongoing performance against
these documents.</p>
<p>In practice, when a frequency event occurs on the power system
resulting in frequency dropping below the levels identified in the
Frequency Operating Standard, the under frequency load shedding schemes
will operate in accordance with the parameters in the UFLS Requirements
and UFLS Specification documents. Other WEM rules (e.g. new section
### 3.2A) are already in place to ensure appropriate coordination between
AEMO as the System Operator and Network Operators.</p></th>

<th><p><strong>Explanatory Note</strong></p>
<p>The primary objective of the new Non-Co-optimised Essential System
Services (NCESS) framework outlined in the Taskforce Paper: A Framework
for Non-Co-optimised Essential System Service is to enable AEMO and
Western Power to identify and justify the need for an ESS not already
available through existing market mechanisms, and to procure those
services in a transparent and efficient manner.</p>
<p>The NCESS framework outlines:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>the roles of the Coordinator, AEMO and Western Power under the
NCESS framework;</p></li>
<li><p>the conditions associated with power system security and
reliability and market costs that would require Western Power and/or
AEMO to trigger an NCESS procurement process;</p></li>
<li><p>Western Power’s and AEMO’s obligations to consult with the
Coordinator of Energy to seek confirmation to trigger an NCESS
procurement process;</p></li>
<li><p>the procurement process that Western Power and AEMO must follow
to procure NCESS;</p></li>
<li><p>the obligations that NCESS Contract holders must follow;</p></li>
<li><p>the rules for NCESS dispatch and settlement; and</p></li>
<li><p>the obligation for Western Power to prepare a Transmission System
Plan.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>An Interim NCESS Framework will commence on 1 February 2022 and apply
until New WEM Commencement Day. As this Companion Version of the WEM
Rules contains the provisions that will apply from the start of the new
market, please see Schedule B of the Tranche 5 Amendments for the
amendments comprising the interim framework (i.e. sections 3.11A and
### 3.11B) that will apply until that time.</p>
<p>This Framework will replace the concept of Dispatch Support Service
contract with an AEMO-procured NCESS contract (i.e., it is no longer an
Ancillary Service), and a Network Control Service contract with a
Network Operator-procured NCESS Contract.</p>
<p>The intent is that any Dispatch Support Service or Network Control
Service contracts entered into after 1 February 2022 will have the
following obligations applied to them:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>AEMO and Western Power will trigger the procurement of
AEMO-procured and NO-procured NCESS respectively. New clauses for
trigger conditions have been drafted (see interim clause 3.11A.2 and
### 3.11A.2A);</p></li>
<li><p>the Coordinator may also trigger at any time based on certain
trigger conditions (see interim clause 3.11A.4);</p></li>
<li><p>the Coordinator will approve the trigger. The ERA will no longer
have a role in approving AEMO’s trigger for procuring NCESS;</p></li>
<li><p>be procured under the new NCESS procurement framework outlined in
section 3.11B; and</p></li>
<li><p>dispatched and settled as per current processes.</p></li>

<p>Clause 3.11A.2 outlines the trigger conditions under which Western
Power or AEMO or both must assess and determine whether to make a
written submission to the Coordinator to trigger the NCESS Procurement
process.</p>
<p>Either entity could form a view that a trigger condition applies, and
it must then make a written submission to the Coordinator. Allowing
either entity to apply to the Coordinator provides a level of guarantee
that at least one entity will seek to trigger, even if the other entity
does not believe the trigger condition applies.</p>
<p>Once a written submission is made to the Coordinator, the Coordinator
may request either or both entities to provide more information or
undertake analysis to assist the Coordinator in deciding whether to
trigger an NCESS procurement process.</p>
<p>Clause 3.11A.2 is amended to improve coordination between AEMO and
Network Operators by requiring a Network Operator to notify AEMO before
the Network Operator makes a submission to request the Coordinator to
determine whether to trigger an NCESS procurement process.</p>
<p>Section 3.11A is expected to be replaced on New WEM Commencement Day
by the <em>Wholesale Electricity Market Amendment (Tranche 5 Amendments)
Rules 2021</em> (Schedule I, paragraph 17.1). Following this
replacement, further amendments will be required to reapply the changes
described in Part 1 of this Exposure Draft to clauses 3.11A.2 (which

<th><p><strong>Explanatory Note</strong></p>
<p>Western Power and AEMO will be responsible for developing the service
specification to procure NCESS. The NCESS procurement process will be a
two-stage process where a draft service specification must be published
on the relevant website and respondents will have the opportunity to
express their interest. This step will enable Western Power and AEMO to
determine whether any suitable providers exist and what solutions they
can provide to meet fully or partially the requirements. Suitability may
depend on several factors such as the type of technology, network
location, operational limitations etc. If suitable providers are not
found, the service specification may need to be modified, or the NCESS
procurement may be postponed or may not proceed.</p>
<p>If the NCESS procurement is to proceed based on the expressions of
interest received, AEMO or Western Power as applicable will issue a
request for tender and a final service specification will then be
published to commence the procurement process. New providers that did
not participate in the first step can also apply.</p>

<th><p><strong>Explanatory Note</strong></p>
<p>New section 3.15A sets out the regime for the new SESSM for procuring
FCESS. This new regime replaces the current contract-based
mechanism.</p>
<p>Set out below is an extract from the Taskforce’s Information Paper
<em>Supplementary ESS Procurement Mechanism</em> to provide some
background to the new regime. You should refer to the Information Paper
for further details.</p>
<p>FCESS will be primarily procured via real-time markets, with
participation from all capable and accredited facilities enabled, but
not mandatory. Nevertheless, to protect against the risk of market
failure in what will be relatively small and concentrated markets, the
Taskforce has endorsed the SESSM to provide a means for longer-term
contractual arrangements to increase certainty, mitigate inefficient
market outcomes, support new market entry, and avoid a shortfall in ESS
accreditation and participation. Contrasting with current arrangements,
the SESSM will be implemented through a transparent tender process in
the WEM Rules, rather than through individually negotiated bilateral
contracts.</p>
<p>The broad objectives of the SESSM are to:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>incentivise new FCESS providers to enter the market;</p></li>
<li><p>mitigate scarcity in FCESS markets, manifesting either as a
shortfall of accredited facilities, or shortfall of participation;
and</p></li>
<li><p>mitigation of market power by:</p></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><blockquote>
<p>the threat of competitive entry; and</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote>
<p>a mechanism of ex-ante review of the operating costs of ESS providers
by the Economic Regulation Authority.</p>
</blockquote></li>
</ul>
<p>The procurement of SESSM broadly consists of seven stages:
Triggering, SESSM Service Specification, Veto of Procurement,
Procurement Process, Selection, Veto of Award, and SESSM.</p></th>

<p>Section 3.15B sets out the regime for a new periodic expressions of
interest process to provide a benchmark for market pricing of ESS. It
sets out a market sounding process in order for AEMO to test the market.
It will not result in the award of SESSM Award but it will assist the
ERA to determine whether the current market price is appropriate and
whether there is a need to trigger the SESSM. Additionally, the process
provides engagement with new facilities to understand the accreditation
process and allows participants to prepare submissions in readiness for
a short lead-time SESSM procurement.</p>
<p>The expressions of interest process is to be run by AEMO but it is
noted that AEMO doesn’t use the information collected through the
process for any SESSM trigger. Instead, it passes the information on to
the ERA.</p>
<p>It is anticipated that the first expressions of interest process will
be run in early 2022, and transitional rules will be developed to
support and give effect to that process.</p></th>

<th><p><strong>Explanatory Note</strong></p>
<p>The definition for 'Outage' is amended in clause 3.18.3. The
definition builds on the definitions of “unavailability” introduced by
Rule Change Proposals RC_2013_15 and RC_2014_03, but has been
restructured to specifically relate to the definition of an Outage.</p>
<p>The Tranches 2 and 3 Amendments created a requirement for Demand Side
Programmes with Capacity Credits to be included on the Equipment
List.</p>
<p>However, the outage quantity calculations in clauses 3.21.6 to
### 3.21.8B do not work properly for Demand Side Programmes and produce
capacity adjusted outage quantities that are always equal to zero. While
the outage quantity calculations could be enhanced to account for Demand
Side Programmes properly, the calculation of a non-zero Forced Outage
quantity for a Demand Side Programme would not lead to payment of
Capacity Cost Refunds because the current refund calculations for Demand
Side Programmes in section 4.26 do not consider Forced Outage
quantities.</p>
<p>Addressing these issues would require material changes, which could
be superseded by the outcomes of the RCM Review. For this reason, Energy
Policy WA proposes to make the following changes to clauses 3.18.3,
### 3.18.4 and 3.18A.3 to remove Demand Side Programmes from the Equipment
List, and to reconsider the treatment of Demand Side Programme outages
more holistically as part of the RCM Review.</p>
<p>Clause 3.18.3 is further amended to clarify:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>that Outages of components of an Outage Facility (e.g. a specific
Facility Technology Type) are covered by the Equipment Limits of that
Facility;</p></li>
<li><p>that the limitation around having to submit Outages for
Semi-Scheduled Facilities and Non‑Scheduled Facilities applies only to
Facilities that contain an Intermittent Generating System;</p></li>
<li><p>the references to Standing Data items in clause 3.18.2(c)(ii);
and</p></li>
<li><p>that the temperature de-rating limitations specified in clause
### 3.18.2(d) do not only apply to Scheduled Facilities.</p></li>

<p>Outage Intention Plans will replace the somewhat unclear current PASA
framework provisions which allow AEMO to require Market Participants to
provide information about their future availability.</p>
<p>Market Participants and Network Operators will be required to submit
a yearly Outage Intention Plan to AEMO. The information provided in each
Outage Intention Plan is less than that required for an Outage, and will
be specified in a WEM Procedure.</p>
<p>AEMO will be required to develop and publish an Annual Consolidated
Outage Intention Plan for information purposes. It will not be binding
on Equipment List Facilities and Self-Scheduling Outage Facilities. A
Market Participant may still submit an Outage Plan for approval up to
three years ahead.</p>
<p>The intention is that Outage Intention Plans will be used by all
Market Participants and Network Operators to plan Outages, with any
conflicts to be resolved before AEMO publishes an Annual Consolidated
Outage Intention Plan.</p>
<p>The intention is for AEMO to publish Annual Consolidated Outage Plans
for the 2024 calendar year which will require Market Participants and
Network Operators to submit Outage Intention Plans from 2023 –
transitional provisions will deal with implementation timing.</p>

<p>Commissioning tests are required to support the reliable operation of
Facilities and equipment, and to confirm the capability of Facilities
and equipment to meet certain standards and provide certain services.
Required tests can also create risks to power system security and
reliability, and so must be planned and coordinated. The existing
commissioning test arrangements are cumbersome and don’t allow for
flexibility in adjusting tests close to real time. Testing often
requires coordination between AEMO and the Network Operator and the
current process can be confusing for Market Participants, including
understanding the information required and when it is required.</p>
<p>Existing section 3.21A is deleted and replaced with a new section
### 3.21A that:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>clarifies the various types of tests for which AEMO’s approval is
required;</p></li>
<li><p>clarifies the submission timelines for various types of tests,
