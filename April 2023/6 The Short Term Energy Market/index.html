<p>Clause 6.3B.1A is amended to restore the current arrangements for the
processing of Standing STEM Submissions for the new WEM, except that the
processing will occur at 8:30 AM on the Scheduling Day instead of 9:00
AM.</p>
<p>The processing time has been moved from the time proposed in Exposure
Draft 1 (i.e. when the Trading Day first enters the STEM Submission
window), in response to a concern raised by Synergy that if</p>
<ul>
<li><p>a STEM Submission is ‘trimmed’ to reflect a Planned Outage that
is subject to a late cancellation; and</p></li>
<li><p>the Market Participant has system issues that prevent it from
updating its STEM Submission on the Scheduling Day,</p></li>
</ul>
<p>then the Market Participant could incur a Net STEM Shortfall and be
exposed to Reserve Capacity refunds.</p>
<p>The new processing time falls after the final lock in of outages for
a Trading Day on the Scheduling Day, which removes any risk that a
Standing STEM Submission will be trimmed based on outage data that
subsequently changes.</p></th>

<th><p><strong>Explanatory Note</strong></p>
<p>The structure of Chapter 7 reflects the integration of the operation
of the Real-Time Market and the Central Dispatch Process in accordance
with the Security Constrained Economic Dispatch (<strong>SCED</strong>)
market model.</p>
<p>More specifically:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Chapter 7 is renamed ‘Real-Time Market Operation and Dispatch’
and substantially amended; and</p></li>
<li><p>Chapters 7A and 7B are deleted.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>As the name implies, SCED determines the most economic dispatch of
individual resources across the SWIS. In the current market, AEMO
schedules energy and Essential System Services separately, and
congestion on the network is accounted for by amendments to the market
dispatch.</p>
<p>The adoption of the SCED market model, which includes consideration
of network constraints in the calculation of dispatch schedules, is
essential for the SWIS in order to maintain system security as
congestion increases. Adopting the SCED market model will require AEMO
to replace the existing market and dispatch systems that it uses to
operate the Wholesale Electricity Market.</p>
<p>Adopting a SCED market model is fundamental to realising the benefits
of the sustainable and efficient management of network constraints, and
is expected to deliver the following benefits.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>transparent determination of the least-cost dispatch outcome for
the market, accounting for generation offers and network conditions, and
allowing Market Participants to respond, resulting in increased
competition in the Real-Time Market and a downward pressure on the
energy price over time;</p></li>
<li><p>greater automation in the calculation of network constraints,
which improves network efficiency by allowing constraints to be set less
conservatively without compromising system reliability; and</p></li>
<li><p>greater automation in the dispatch process, so that system
security can be managed efficiently as the level of constraints
increases, and the generation mix continues to change.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>However, various clauses in Chapter 7 are also amended by the October
2021 RCM Pricing Amendments, including as a result of tranche based
dispatch payments for DSPs ceasing from the 2019 Reserve Capacity Cycle
(i.e. from the 2021 Capacity Year), the Tranche 1 Amendments, the
Miscellaneous Amendments No. 1 and the Amending Rules contained in the
Rule Change Panel's Final Report for Rule Change Proposal RC_2014_03
(Administrative Improvements to the Outage Process). As Chapter 7 is
deleted to reflect the amendments contained in the Tranches 2 and 3
Amendments, as those amending rules (made by the Minister at the date
this companion version was prepared) will be commenced last, please
refer to the October 2021 RCM Pricing Amendments, Tranche 1 Amendments,
Miscellaneous Amendments No. 1 and the Final Report for Rule Change
Proposal RC_2014_03 (Administrative Improvements to the Outage Process)
to see the changes to Chapter 7 that will either apply until the
Tranches 2 and 3 Amendments to Chapter 7 commence, or that amend
amending rules contained in the Tranches 2 and 3 Amendments.</p>
<p>Several clauses in Chapter 7 of the current WEM Rules have also been
amended by the Tranche 5 Amendments (Schedule B). However, as this
Chapter 7 reflects the amendments that will apply from the start of the
new market, please refer to the Tranche 5 Amendments to see the
amendments to those clauses that will apply until that time.</p>
<p>The key changes proposed to the Real-Time Market arrangements in
Chapter 7 pursuant to the Tranche 6 Amendments include:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>changes to the rules around the provision and use of Injection
and Withdrawal forecasts for Semi-Scheduled Facilities and Non-Scheduled
Facilities;</p></li>
<li><p>changes to the obligations to provide Real-Time Market
Submissions for Non-Scheduled Facilities;</p></li>
<li><p>clarification of how AEMO uses Real-Time Market Submissions for
Non-Scheduled Facilities in the Central Dispatch Process;</p></li>
<li><p>changes to the submission and dispatch arrangements for Demand
Side Programmes;</p></li>
<li><p>clarification of the terminology, content requirements and
processing rules for Real-Time Market Submissions; and</p></li>
<li><p>changes to the publication requirements for dispatch-related
information.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The changes are described in more detail in the Explantory Notes to
the relevant sections of Chapter 7.</p></th>

</ul>
<p>An overview of the main changes affecting section 7.4 is provided
below.</p>
<p><strong>Changes to Real-Time Market Submission terminology and
processing rules</strong></p>
<p>Section 7.4 has been amended to clarify the definitions of “Real-Time
Market Submission” and “Standing Real-Time Market Submission” and the
general processing rules for these submissions. Under the proposed
changes:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>A Real-Time Market Submission relates to a Registered Facility,
Market Service and Dispatch Interval.</p></li>
<li><p>A Market Participant may include multiple Real-Time Market
Submissions in a single electronic submission. AEMO will either accept
the electronic submission (and all the Real-Time Market Submissions
within it) or reject the electronic submission (and all the Real-Time
Market Submissions within it).</p></li>
<li><p>A Standing Real-Time Market Submission is a default Real-Time
Market Submission for a Registered Facility and Market Service for
Dispatch Intervals starting at specified times on Trading Days of a
specified type.</p></li>
<li><p>A Market Participant may include multiple Standing Real-Time
Market Submissions in a single electronic submission, but must ensure
that the Standing Real-Time Market Submissions in an electronic
submission for a Registered Facility and Market Service, in combination,
uniquely specify the default Real-Time Market Submission to apply for
each Dispatch Interval in a generic Trading Week.</p></li>
<li><p>At any point in time, the Real-Time Market Submission for a
Registered Facility, Market Service and Dispatch Interval is the
(variation) Real-Time Market Submission most recently accepted by AEMO
under clause 7.4.49(a)(i), or, if no such submission exists, the most
recently accepted applicable Standing Real-Time Market
Submission.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Changes to the provision and use of Injection and Withdrawal
forecasts for Semi-Scheduled Facilities and Non-Scheduled
Facilities</strong></p>
<p>Previously, a Market Participant was required to ensure that the sum
of the quantities in the Price-Quantity Pairs for Injection in its
Semi-Scheduled Facility Real-Time Market Submission was equal to the
Market Participant’s unconstrained Injection forecast for the Facility.
While this arrangement provided an Injection forecast to AEMO, it could
also restrict the level to which the Facility could be dispatched,
because of the absence of Price-Quantity Pairs covering Injection levels
above the Market Participant’s forecast. Additionally, the arrangement
did not support the provision of Withdrawal forecasts.</p>
<p>Under the proposed new arrangements, the quantities in the
Price-Quantity Pairs for energy for a Semi-Scheduled Facility or
Non-Scheduled Facility should sum to the maximum quantity that the
Market Participant considers the Facility could Inject/Withdraw assuming
it was not constrained by AEMO (including on price), i.e. assuming no
shortage of any intermittent fuel such as wind. The Market Participant
will also include an Unconstrained Injection Forecast and Unconstrained
Withdrawal Forecast, defined as follows, in each Real-Time Market
Submission:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Unconstrained Injection Forecast</strong>: The expected
MW level of Injection at the end of a Dispatch Interval for a
Semi-Scheduled Facility or Non-Scheduled Facility, assuming that the
Facility will not be subject to a Dispatch Instruction or direction from
AEMO that limits its Injection, and allowing for expected conditions,
commitment and control intentions and the effect of any Outages that
have not been rejected for the Facility.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Unconstrained Withdrawal Forecast</strong>: The expected
MW level of Withdrawal at the end of a Dispatch Interval for a
Semi-Scheduled Facility or Non-Scheduled Facility, assuming that the
Facility will not be subject to a Dispatch Instruction or direction from
AEMO that limits its Withdrawal, and allowing for expected conditions,
commitment and control intentions and the effect of any Outages that
have not been rejected for the Facility</p></li>
</ul>
<p>AEMO may use the Unconstrained Injection Forecasts and Unconstrained
Withdrawal Forecasts provided in Real-Time Market Submissions as inputs
to the Dispatch Algorithm, but may also use alternative forecasts if it
reasonably considers they are likely to be more accurate.</p>
<p>Price-Quantity Pairs will continue to be used within the Dispatch
Algorithm to determine Dispatch Caps for Semi-Scheduled Facilities.
However, Semi-Scheduled Facilities will not be constrained where their
Unconstrained Injection Forecasts or Unconstrained Withdrawal Forecasts
are lower than the cleared Price-Quantity Pairs.</p>
<p><strong>Changes to Real-Time Market Submission obligations for
Non-Scheduled Facilities</strong>:</p>
<p>It is important for AEMO to have visibility of a Non-Scheduled
Facility’s intentions to support the production of forward-looking
Market Schedules and provide overall transparency to the market. For
this reason, Market Participants will be required to submit Real-Time
Market Submissions for their Non-Scheduled Facilities.</p>
<p>The submission requirements for Non-Scheduled Facilities have been
separated from the requirements for the Registered Facilities being
actively dispatched by AEMO through the Dispatch Algorithm (Scheduled
Facilities, Semi-Scheduled Facilities and Interruptible Loads). The
Market Participant must declare its intentions (either Injection or
Withdrawal) by including a single Price-Quantity Pair at the price
cap/floor. The Market Participant will also provide an Unconstrained
Injection Forecast and Unconstrained Withdrawal Forecast for each
Dispatch Interval.</p>
<p>These inputs will be used in the Dispatch Algorithm to account for
the expected impact of Non‑Scheduled Facilities, and will be included in
the publication requirements to support transparency.</p>
<p>While Market Participants will be required to make Real-Time Market
Submissions for Non-Scheduled Facilities, they will have a lower
threshold for updating their submissions to reflect that they are not
actively dispatched. The obligation to maintain accurate forecast
quantities for a Non-Scheduled Facility will not attract civil
penalties, and the requirement to update forecast quantities is reduced
to when information supporting underlying expectations has significantly
changed or the Market Participant is knowingly intervening in the
operation of the Facility (e.g. has specific knowledge about Outages,
commitment or control intentions of behind-the-meter components), as
provided for under new clause 7.4.37A.</p>
<p><strong>Relocation of provisions relating to Demand Side Programme
submissions:</strong></p>
<p>The provisions relating to DSP Withdrawal Profile Submissions and
Standing DSP Withdrawal Profile Submissions have been moved from section
7.4 to a new section 7.4A.</p></th>

<p>Amendments to clause 7.4.5 address the following issues:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>When the Pre-Dispatch Schedule projects a shortfall in a
Frequency Control Essential System Service (FCESS), clause 7.4.5(b)
requires SESSM Award holders to update their Real-Time Market
Submissions to offer all the available accredited capacity of their
awarded Facilities as In‑Service Capacity. This could result in more
capacity being offered as In-Service Capacity than is necessary or
desirable.</p></li>
<li><p>The clause does not correctly account for a Facility that is not
subject to any Outage in a Dispatch Interval, e.g. clause 7.4.5(a) would
require the Market Participant to offer the maximum accredited quantity
of the relevant FCESS instead of the contracted quantity in this
situation.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Under the amendments, a Market Participant holding a SESSM Award
must:</p>
<ul>
<li><blockquote>
<p>under normal conditions, offer (at least) the lower of their
contracted quantity and available accredited capacity in the relevant
FCESS, as either Available or In-Service Capacity (clause 7.4.5(a));</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote>
<p>if the Reference Scenario for a Pre-Dispatch Interval projects a
shortfall in the FCESS, ensure that they are offering all their
available accredited capacity in the FCESS, as either Available or
In‑Service Capacity (clause 7.4.5(b)); and</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote>
<p>if the Reference Scenario for a Pre-Dispatch Interval or Dispatch
Interval projects that the relevant Facility will be enabled to provide
the FCESS, ensure that they are offering the relevant Essential System
Service Enablement Quantity as In-Service Capacity, as well as
sufficient In-Service energy capacity to facilitate the FCESS enablement
(clause 7.4.5(c)).</p>
</blockquote></li>
</ul>
<p>The available accredited capacity of the Facility in the relevant
FCESS is determined as:</p>

<p>Feedback from AEMO’s implementation program identified a number of
issues with the proposal to include Demand Side Programmes in the
Dispatch Algorithm, including:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>the potential for inaccurate identification of potential Demand
Side Programme dispatch in the forward Market Schedules;</p></li>
<li><p>issues with the proposed tie-breaking approach; and</p></li>
<li><p>issues relating to the need to take into account the specific
restrictions associated with the dispatch of Demand Side Programmes,
e.g. notice periods, hours available for dispatch, maximum hours of
dispatch per year, etc).</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Due to these issues, Demand Side Programmes will not be dispatched
using the Dispatch Algorithm. Instead, an alternative approach has been
developed for the dispatch of these Facilities.</p>
<p>A key component of this approach is the requirement for Market
Participants to provide DSP Withdrawal Profile Submissions that specify
two forecast quantities for each Dispatch Interval:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>a DSP Unconstrained Withdrawal Quantity, which is the Market
Participant’s estimate of the average MW consumption of its Demand Side
Programme in the Dispatch Interval assuming that the Demand Side
Programme is not affected by any Dispatch Instruction or Reserve
Capacity Test; and</p></li>
<li><p>a DSP Constrained Withdrawal Quantity, which the DSP
Unconstrained Withdrawal Quantity adjusted to take into account the
impact of any impending dispatch or Reserve Capacity Tests about which
the Market Participant has been advised.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The two values are expected to be identical for most Dispatch
Intervals.</p>
<p>New section 7.4A sets out the obligations with respect to DSP
Withdrawal Profile Submissions. The clauses below are structured
similarly to the clauses in section 7.4 (Real-Time Market Submissions),
but are included in a separate section to reflect that these obligations
apply only to Demand Side Programmes.</p></th>

Interval in the Week-Ahead Schedule Horizon for each of its Demand Side
Programmes.</p>
<p>7.4A.2. If <abbr title="Australian Energy Market Operator">AEMO</abbr> has not accepted a DSP Withdrawal Profile Submission for
a Demand Side Programme and Dispatch Interval under clause 7.4A.15(a),

<p>Clause 7.6.23 deals with tiebreaking arrangements. As most of the
tiebreaking will be undertaken post-processing, AEMO will be given the
ability to override Dispatch Algorithm outputs in certain circumstances
without negating the entire process.</p>
<p>The intent of the priority order is to resolve tied offers by:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>ensuring Registered Facilities are able to meet Dispatch
Targets;</p></li>
<li><p>preferring Registered Facilities that would maintain consistency
with dispatch in the previous Dispatch Interval;</p></li>
<li><p>preferring DSPs over other types of Registered Facilities to
preserve flexible capacity (this is expected to only occur where there
is a shortfall – if both are offered at the price cap, we would rather
retain the flexibility of the other facility (e.g. a battery
discharging) than the inflexible DSP);</p></li>
<li><p>preferring DSPs that do not share an Associated Load with an
Interruptible Load over DSPs that do; and</p></li>
<li><p>ensuring dispatch would be shared between tied offers. For
example, if 10MW was required and the Generator A tied offer tranche is
for 20MW, Generator B tied offer tranche is for 30MW, the pro-rata
loading would be 4MW for Generator A and 6MW for Generator B.</p></li>

Programmes from the Dispatch Algorithm. Note that the requirement in
clause 7.6.23(d) has been relocated to clause 7.6.5B(b)(iii).</p>
<p>Clause 7.6.23 has been further amended to remove clause 7.6.23(b).

<p>7.11B. Determination of Market Clearing Prices</p>
<p>7.11B.1. Subject to section 7.11C, where <abbr title="Australian Energy Market Operator">AEMO</abbr> runs the Dispatch
Algorithm, <abbr title="Australian Energy Market Operator">AEMO</abbr> must determine a Market Clearing Price for each Market
Service for a Dispatch Interval.</p>
<p>7.11B.1A. If <abbr title="Australian Energy Market Operator">AEMO</abbr> fails to run the Dispatch Algorithm to determine
Market Clearing Prices for any Dispatch Interval, then the Market
Clearing Prices for that Dispatch Interval are:</p>
<p><span class="arithmatex">\(a\)</span> if the Dispatch Interval has been included in a previous Dispatch
Schedule, the Market Clearing Prices determined for the Dispatch
Interval in the most recent Dispatch Schedule that includes the Dispatch
Interval; or</p>

Dispatch Schedule, the Market Clearing Prices determined for the
Pre-Dispatch Interval containing the Dispatch Interval in the Reference
Scenario for the most recent Pre-Dispatch Schedule that includes the
Dispatch Interval.</p>
<p>7.11B.2. Subject to clauses 7.11B.3, 7.11B.4 and 7.11B.5, the Market
Clearing Price for a Market Service represents the marginal value of
that Market Service at the Reference Node at that time, which is
calculated as the cost of meeting an incremental change in the
requirement for the Market Service at that time in accordance with

<p>Section 7.13 is amended to reflect the amended relevant information
under these WEM Rules.</p>
<p>Section 7.13 is amended to clarify where information must be provided
directly to Market Participants (e.g. via a portal or B2B mechanism) or
published on the WEM Website, and the associated timeframes.</p>
<p>The WEM Website is a lower availability solution than a Market
Participant interface, therefore while AEMO must make efforts to publish
data in a timely manner to the WEM Website, there are occasions where
making the data available may be delayed (e.g. WEM Website maintenance,
or general data latency).</p>
<p>The changes in this section include:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>separating the requirements to make certain information available
to Market Participants from the requirements to publish that information
on the WEM Website;</p></li>
<li><p>clarifying the requirements for demand forecasts and the
reporting of actual Injection and Withdrawal quantities;</p></li>
<li><p>removing the requirement to publish non-Reference Scenario Market
Schedule information on the WEM Website (note the information will still
be made available to Market Participants and will Public
Information);</p></li>
<li><p>reducing the maximum delay permitted in publishing Market
Schedule-related information on the WEM Website to one Business Day;
and</p></li>
<li><p>minor enhancements to improve the clarity of the
drafting.</p></li>

AEMO is required to produce in order to run Relevant Level calculations.
