<th><p><strong>Explanatory Note</strong></p>
<p>Changes to clause 2.16.2A allow the ERA to provide AEMO a list of WEM
Rules that AEMO must monitor for compliance, and new clause 2.16.2AA
allows AEMO and the ERA to negotiate on the types of information
included (based on practicality and cost) and the time and date this
information is provided. The intent of this policy change is to allow
the ERA more flexibility in directing AEMO to monitor compliance with
Rule changes where AEMO is the party best placed to do so, and for this
list of WEM Rules monitoring by AEMO to change over time to remain more
relevant as the market evolves. Transparency will be provided to Market
Participants on the types of information being provided through the
Market Surveillance Data Catalogue (MSDC) and WEM Rules being monitored
by AEMO as both of these will be combined and published as one list for
transparency.</p>
<p>Changes to 2.16.2E and 2.16.2F are consequential to this policy
change.</p></th>

<th><p><strong>Explanatory Note</strong></p>
<p>In order not to unnecessarily delay processes or introduce a decision
maker other than AEMO and the relevant Network Operator in respect of
generator performance standards, certain parts of Chapter 3A will not be
subject to the general ability to raise a dispute under the WEM Rules.
These are:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>a decision to exempt generating works connected to a transmission
system;</p></li>
<li><p>a decision to refuse to renegotiate a Registered Generator
Performance Standard;</p></li>
<li><p>a decision in respect of a Rectification Plan; and</p></li>
<li><p>a decision to declare a Potential Relevant Generation
Modification to be a Relevant Generator Modification.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Clause 2.18.1 is amended to remove the dispute resolution mechanism
in section 1.42 for Existing Transmission Connected Market Generators
from the dispute process so that the dispute resolution mechanism in
section 1.42 is the only mechanism to resolve such disputes (other than
any rights a party has under law). Decisions by AEMO as to extensions to
submit a Generator Monitoring Plan under clause 1.41.4 will also be
exempt from the disputes regime.</p>
<p>Clause 2.18.1 is further amended to exclude disputes about Market
Information, which are dealt with under section 10.5.</p></th>

<th><p><strong>Explanatory Note</strong></p>
<p>Section 2.22A. is amended to address the shortcomings with the
current rules relating to the determination of AEMO’s budget. This
includes replacing transitional rules with the specific function to
facilitate and prepare for Market Evolution.</p>
<p>The current rules are restrictive for the Regulator (limited
discretion in determining if individual projects are prudent, limited
review and information gathering time/powers). This has resulted in
poorly evidenced submissions with the onus on the ERA to determine
efficient funding levels.</p>
<p>The amendments will seek to achieve the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>enable regulatory scrutiny and enhance transparency by:</p></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><p>identifying projects/functions and related costs up front;
and</p></li>
<li><p>increasing transparency over funding allocation and actual
expenditures;</p></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><p>deal with uncertainty by allowing partial approvals and limited
in-period reopening; and</p></li>
<li><p>promote greater regulatory certainty through guidelines to be
issued and published by the ERA including:</p></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><p>procedure guidelines; and</p></li>
<li><p>submission and reporting guidelines.</p></li>

redundant reference to System Management) that commenced on 1 October
2021.</p>
<p>Since then, further amendments to the relevant provisions amended by
the Tranches 2 and 3 Amendments have been made via the Tranche 6
Amendments to retain/reinstate the reference to Coordinator fees (i.e.

<p>Clause 2.28.1 has been amended to reflect the Taskforce's decisions
described in the <em>Information Paper: Registration and Participation
Framework in the Wholesale Electricity Market</em>.</p>
<p>A new ‘Market Participant’ class will be created to replace the
existing Market Generator, Market Customer and Ancillary Service
Provider classes. This category will denote a participant who provides
or consumes a WEM product or service (i.e. any participant that is part
of the financial settlement process). A Market Participant will have
obligations in respect of its Facilities, therefore, a Market
Participant must register its Facilities, subject to any exemptions
permitted under the WEM Rules.</p>

<th><p><strong>Explanatory Note</strong></p>
<p>To support the Taskforce design decision to incorporate a lifecycle
approach to registration, Market Participants will be required to notify
AEMO whenever the configuration of their Facility changes as this may
affect the classification of the Facility.</p>
<p>Under the new arrangements registration will need to be an ongoing
process from Facility creation to deregistration. This is to ensure that
AEMO has the information required to inform scheduling and dispatch
while maintaining system security, and that necessary obligations apply
to a Facility through the operation of the WEM Rules.</p>
<p>New provisions have been incorporated to outline the Facility Class
reassessment process to be followed by Market Participants and AEMO.</p>
<p>Clause 2.29.6 outlines the process under the WEM Rules by which a
Market Participant may trigger a Facility Class reassessment request for
a Registered Facility.</p>
<p>The scope of clauses 2.29.6 excludes Demand Side Programmes and
Interruptible Loads, as Facilities registered in these Facility Classes
are not subject to the reclassification if the configuration of their
Facility changes. Instead, for Demand Side Programmes and Interruptible
Loads, a Market Participant or AEMO may trigger the Load association and
or the disassociation process in accordance with clause 2.29.5 and
changes to the configuration of an Interruptible Load will require ESS
re-accreditation.</p>
<p>Requirements have also been updated in sections 2.31 and 2.33 to
incorporate the Facility Class reassessment process initiated by a
Market Participant and the required application form.</p></th>

<p>The scope of section 2.30 therefore only covers the aggregation of

<p>Section 2.30 clarifies the aggregation process and timelines.
Currently sections 2.31 to 2.33 excludes facility
aggregation/disaggregation. While a head of power for an
aggregation/disaggregation WEM Procedure exists, amendments to sections

<th><p><strong>Explanatory Note</strong></p>
<p>Clause 2.30.5(c) is a consequential amendment as a result of the new
Essential System Services framework, which does not use the term
‘Ancillary Service Contract’.</p>
<p>Clause 2.30.5(f) precludes AEMO from aggregating, or allowing to
continue to be aggregated, Facilities where the price for Reserve
Capacity to be provided by those Facilities is not, or is not expected
to be, the same.</p>
<p>Section 3.1.1 of the Energy Scheduling and Dispatch Information paper
sets out the criteria that AEMO must apply when approving the
aggregation of Facilities, so that the locational dispatch and
co-optimisation of ESS envisaged by the SCED reforms can be
effected.</p>
<p>Paragraph (g) of clause 2.30.5 represents this intent, and is
intended to convey the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>AEMO cannot approve an aggregation that would lead to the
over-procurement of Contingency Reserve Raise ESS as a result of
reflecting the output of the Aggregated Facility as the contingency (in
the relevant ESS constraint) in SCED when the credible contingency is
the individual loss of each component Facility. This is not an issue
when the aggregation is so small, that the impact on Contingency Reserve
Raise ESS procurement is negligible or nil.</p></li>
<li><p>AEMO cannot approve an aggregation where the Aggregated Facility
would be providing ESS, and the ESS capability (ESS trapezium) cannot be
accurately depicted for the Aggregated Facility in its entirety. It
should be noted the Facility capable of providing ESS, must offer its
ESS quantity at its connection points for the whole Facility, not at the
Facility’s sub-component level.</p></li>
<li><p>AEMO may only aggregate Facilities if the proposed Aggregated
Facility are at the same Electrical Location. Figure 1 and Figure 2
below illustrate configurations in which aggregation is allowed and not
allowed.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Figure 1 – Aggregation is allowed as Facilities are located at the

Different Electrical Locations.</p>
<p><img src="media/image2.png"
style="width:5.95583in;height:3.91667in" /></p>
<p>In addition, clause 2.30.5 (b) has been amended slightly to clarify
the fact that:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The aggregation may comprise both registered and unregistered
Facilities; and</p></li>
<li><p>AEMO may require Standing Data in respect of the aggregation as
opposed to just the individual Facilities comprising the
aggregation.</p></li>

currently manageable (due to the small amount of auxiliary load not

<p>Clauses 2.32.7BA and 2.32.7BB provide AEMO with an efficient and
practicable process to issue a Suspension Notice or Registration
Correction Notice where a Rule Participant no longer legally exists
(e.g. liquidated) or is under administration. Currently, section 2.32
only provides AEMO with the head of power to issue a Suspension Notice
and/or a Registration Correction Notice to the Rule Participant, but
does not clearly address situations where the legal entity no longer
exists or is under administration.</p>
<p>Clause 2.32.7BA is further amended to reflect changes made in March
2017 to the Corporations Act, which removed the definition of
‘externally-administered body corporate’.</p></th>

<p>Transitional rules and procedures are separately under development to
give effect to the Taskforce decision that all Registered Facilities
which are participating in Ancillary Services provision in the 2020
Capacity Year must be accredited to provide the equivalent FCESS from
the start of the new WEM in October 2022. The transitional arrangements
will also provide information to industry on how the Essential System
Service accreditation will be implemented, allowing other interested
Market Participants to accredit their Registered Facilities in
accordance with the relevant rules well-ahead of new market start.</p>
<p>Facilities providing Non-Co-optimised Essential System Services
(<strong>NCESS</strong>) will not be required to be accredited in
accordance with the regime set out in section 2.34A. However, it is
expected that those Facilities will need to meet certain requirements
that will be reflected in the amending rules that are to be developed
for NCESS in early 2021.</p>

<p>Section 2.37 is amended to decrease the maximum number of days of
prudential exposure from 70 days to 35 days to reflect the new weekly
settlement timeline and the decreased lag between trading and
settlement.</p>
<p>References to ‘Market Participant’ in clauses 2.37 – 2.43 have been
replaced with ‘Rule Participant’ where necessary to reflect that Western
Power will be liable for RoCoF costs (unless it meets the exemption
criteria – see Appendix 2B) and therefore AEMO must determine the
prudential requirements for Western Power.</p></th>
